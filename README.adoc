= GBIF Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT)

The Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) is a free, open source software tool provided by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and used to publish and share biodiversity datasets through the https://www.gbif.org/[GBIF network]. The IPT can also be configured with a DataCite account in order to assign DOIs to datasets, thus transforming it into a data repository.
