= GBIF Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT)

The Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) is a free, open source software tool used to publish and share biodiversity datasets through the https://www.gbif.org/[GBIF network]. The IPT can also be configured with a DataCite account in order to assign DOIs to datasets, thus transforming it into a data repository.

In this repository you can find the IPT source code, https://ipt.gbif.org/manual/[IPT User Manual] source code, and the https://github.com/gbif/ipt/issues[IPT issue tracker].
