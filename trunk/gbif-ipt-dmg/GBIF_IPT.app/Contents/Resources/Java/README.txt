The entire changelog can be found here:

http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?version=13874&styleName=Text&projectId=10311

This release is based on Geotools 2.4-SNAPSHOT, tag = geoserver-1.6.0-rc2,
revision = 28406

GeoServer 1.6-rc1
---------------------

The main focus of this release is bug fixing, bringing us very close to a final release.
Notable changes:
* more reprojection support in wfs (to handle requests with geometries expressed in a
  SRS other than the feature type native one)
* wfs 1.1 is now usable and conforms to the specification even with lon/lat oriented
  data sources (the default output is lat/lon thought, as the spec mandates)
* some external graphics related issues were fixed, as well as some layer labelling order issues
* component WMS is now supported, so it's possible to direct a wms call to a remote wfs
  source without configuring the wfs layer into GeoServer
* sld library  mode does not conform to the SLD 1.0 specification (this will break some
  client that used the old non conformant behaviour, we'll restore it as a fallback in rc2)
* problems with connection pool exhaustion during GeoServer configuration tshould be gone
* issues in migration from GeoServer 1.5.0/1.5.1/1.5.2 data directory should be fixed
* logging configuration issues should be gone, GeoServer fully uses log4j now
 

For a full change log see:
http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10311&styleName=Html&version=13631

This release is based on GeoTools 2.4-SNAPSHOT, tag geoserver-1.6-rc1, revision 27907

GeoServer 1.6-beta4
---------------------

The main focus of this release is bug fixing.
We tried to fix most of the outstanding bugs in order to have a final
beta. Notable changes and fixes are:
* logging issues under windows should be fixed
* KML output from layer preview is back at work
* added support for component WMS, that is, the ability to render on the fly data provided by
  another WFS server, where the server and the feature type are specified in the WMS request itself,
  such as: 
  http://localhost:8080/geoserver/wms?...&styles=population&...&layers=topp:states&...&remote_ows_type=WFS&remote_ows_url=http://sigma.openplans.org:8080/geoserver/wfs
* better mime type detection for static file published in data_dir/www
* upgraded GeoJSON output to the latest draft available at geojson.org
* support for right to left languages in labelling
* support for deploy into Oracle Application Server
* improved labelling (labels are now better centered into their halos)
* various minor KML improvements, including the ability to use external graphics for point symbolizers
  and to add ogc filters to KML reflector calls
  
Please download and test, test test. We'll be releasing a RC1 soon, so this is the right time
to point out any problem you may encounter with GeoServer 1.6.0.

For a full change log have a look at:
http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10311&styleName=Html&version=13619

This release is based on GeoTools 2.4-SNAPSHOT, tag geoserver-1.6-beta4, revision 27634

GeoServer 1.6-beta3
---------------------

The main focus of this release is WMS performance. 
We did introduce a new non antialiasing rendering mode that can be enabled by
appending &format_options=antialias:none to the GetMap request that can generate
images with an optimal palette automatically, greatly reducing the resulting image
size (up to 4 times smaller than the standard paletted output, and 10 times smaller
than the full color png output).
We also worked on rendering performance, making standard rendering up to 2 times faster, and 
up to 6 times faster in the specific case of shapefiles (using the non antialiased rendering
mode, with antialias and translucency in the picture the speed up is not as big, but still
very interesting).

Another major news is the the integration of the WFS datastore in the release, we went
through some testing and we are now capable of WFS cascading. This functionality is still
quite new, so help us test it out.

GeoJSON output is now integrated in the release as a standard output format.

We also had various fixes in WFS, such as the ability to query with bboxes and geometries 
in SRS other than the feature native one.

For a full change log have a look at:

GeoServer 1.3.0-RC2 README file
--------------------------------

The issue log for this release is here:
http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&pid=10311&fixfor=11771

This release is based on the geotools 2.1.0 release (2.1.x svn branch).

1. JAI should no longer be required - this time I mean it.
      If you get an error regarding a security issue (because the jars a 'sealed')
      please leave a message on the geoserver-devel mailing list.  This will only
      occur if you installed JAI.  You can do one of the following:
          a) remove from the lib/ directory "jai-core-1.1.3-alpha.jar",
              "jai_imageio-1.1-alpha.jar" and "jai_codec-1.1.3-alpha.jar".
          b) uninstall JAI
      I've had one report of this problem and I think I solved it.  I
      have been unable to reproduce the issue.
      
2. I believe I fixed the error-logging issue for tomcat users.  Please
   tell me if the problem still occurs.
   
3. You can now use <Function> elements in your WFS <Filter>

4. KML (google map) output supported (james macgill)

5. Several other bugs fixed in geoserver and geotools


If you look at the roadmap for the next few releases 
(http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GEOS?report=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project:roadmap-panel)
you should see we are very rapidly approaching whats required for the 1.3.0 release.

The geoserver-devel mailing list has been "bursting at the seams" recently with 
good ideas and discussions for whats going to be happening over the longer term.

GeoServer 1.3.0-RC1 README file
--------------------------------
0.  No longer relies on JAI!

1.  Moved to Geotools 2.1.x branch
2.  GetCapabilities (WFS and WMS) better reflect the added functionality + other fixes

GeoServer 1.3.0-beta3 README file
--------------------------------

Major Changes
-------------
1. Geoserver now passes all WFS and WMS CITE tests
2. Geoserver WMS now does reprojection
     You can use "&SRS=NONE" if you dont want to do any reprojection.
3. Geoserver now allows you to define your geoserver data directory
    (previously called "GEOSERVER_HOME") - see below
4. Added a bunch of "helpers" for SRS (spatial referencing system) since people will have to define their SRSs now
5. Full SLD schema validation support



Minor Changes
-------------
1. bug fixes
2. set of lite renderer improvements
3. added a WFS lock tutorial (http://geoserver.org/display/GEOS/Feature+Locking)
4. upgraded to latest geotools


You can define your geoserver data directory in three ways:

1."GEOSERVER_DATA_DIR" system property.
   this will most likely have come from "java -DGEOSERVER_DATA_DIR=..."
or from you web container's GUI
2. "GEOSERVER_DATA_DIR" in the web.xml document:
     <context-param>
            <param-name>GEOSERVER_DATA_DIR</param-name>
            <param-value>c:\myGeoserverData</param-value>
     </context-param>
3. Defaults to the old behavior - ie. the application root - usually "server/geoserver" in your .WAR.




To make a new one of these data directories, just:

1. create the data directory
2. copy "data/" from an already running geoserver
3. create a "WEB-INF/" directory
5. copy "catalog.xml" and "services.xml" into the WEB-INF/ directory

Supporting GeoServer
--------------------
If you like GeoServer and are using it, we ask you to kindly add yourself to 
our user map at http://www.moximedia.com:8080/imf-ows/imf.jsp?site=gs_users  
Doing so helps ensure our continued funding, as our primary funder wants to 
know that people are actually using the project.  The map also serves as a 
demonstration of GeoServer as it is built using GeoServer for the queries and 
MapServer to display.

Documentation
-------------
Documentation is available online at 
http://geoserver.sourceforge.net/documentation/index.html
The documentation is also available for download from sourceforge, and can
be built from the source downloading using the 'ant document' command.

Additional  wiki-based documentation is available at:
http://geoserver.org/display/GEOS/Home

Additional Geotools documentation is available at:
http://www.geotools.org/

Commercial Support
------------------
For users who need support faster than the email lists and forums can provide
Refractions Research offers commercial grade support.  They can assist with
installations, customizations, and day to day operations.  If GeoServer is 
lacking certain features compared to commercial WFS's we recommend contacting
Refractions as the money required to implement the needed features may 
be less than the license for proprietary software.  For more 
information see http://refractions.net/geoserver/support.html

Support is also available by axios (http://axios.es/index_en.html) the 
contact person is gabriel (groldan@axios.es). 

Bugs
----------
We've tested the release extensively, but we can not possibly test all possible
servlet container, operating system, and data store combinations.  So please 
make use of our JIRA task tracker at: 
http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/BrowseProject.jspa?id=10311 or email 
geoserver-devel@lists.sourceforge.net or geoserver-user@lists.sourceforge.net.  
It's the only way we can know to fix them.  And
if you can fix the bugs yourself even better, as the source is open and we're
always more than happy to take patches.
