# BUILDING THE STANDALONE APPLICATION #
#######################################

The IPT comes with an embedded jetty server and 2 startup scripts for unix (server.sh) and windows (server.bat).
Currently there is no automated build procedure, but the manual process is very simple:

1. build the WAR via "mvn package" (development) or "mvn -P release package" (production)
2. create a new directory "ipt"
3. copy the generated war into "ipt", explode it (=unzip) and call it "webapp". You can delete the remaining war
4. move the server.sh script and server-readme.txt from WEB-INF/classes into the "ipt" folder
5. Done. Test in terminal: 
  "cd xyz/ipt"
  "chmod ugo+x server.*"
  "./server.sh 7002"
