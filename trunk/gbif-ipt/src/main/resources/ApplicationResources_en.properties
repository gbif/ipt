##
# Notes to developers:
# Please maintain sensible groupings within this file (Do not use Attesoro to work in this file)
# Please consider promoting generic messages out of specific sections for better reuse
# Please consider that people will be translating this file and simplifying this for them
#   is a priority
##

##
# Recommended practice of translation without using Attesoro:
#
# Attesoro breaks the grouping of this properties file and makes maintenance cumbersome among
# language groups. We recommend using any text editors with the native2ascii command-line tools
# to work on the translation tasks. native2ascii is a tool coming with default JDK installation.
#
# To add/update translation to properties files, using Chinese as an example:
# 1. Convert the properties file to UTF-8 so characters are displayed in non-escaped form and can be
#    read by traslators.
#
#   $ native2ascii -reverse -encoding UTF-8 ApplicationResources_zh.properties ApplicationResources_zh.native
#
# 2. Find the property and edit the translation.
# 3. When finished, convert the properties file again to ASCII:
#
#   $ native2ascii -encoding UTF-8 ApplicationResources_zh.native ApplicationResources_zh.properties
#
# 4. Commit the converted file to IPT code repository.
#
# This way the grouping is kept and is easier for others to find relevant translations.

Do not select a folder that is vulnerable to other processes, such as /tmp, which may be emptied on a system restart. This folder should be backed up regularly in keeping with a disaster recovery plan.<br/>For example, use a path such as "C\:\\datadir" for Windows environments or "/usr/datadir" for Unix-like environments such as Linux, Mac OS X.

GBIF recommends IPT administrators try Test mode first in order to understand the registration process, and then reinstall in Production mode for formal data publishing. <strong>Warning</strong>: for a given installation, this selection is final and cannot be changed later on. To switch from test to production mode or vice versa, you will have to reinstall your IPT and repeat any configurations you made.
admin.config.setup2.mode.test=<strong>Test</strong> mode is for evaluating the IPT or running it in a training scenario. Registrations will go into a test registry and resources will never be indexed.
admin.config.setup2.mode.production=<strong>Production</strong> mode is for publishing resources formally. Resources are registered into the GBIF Registry and will be indexed.
