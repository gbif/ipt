+ Background Information +

The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) works to make digital 
biodiversity data openly and freely available on the Internet for everyone. 
GBIF provides access to scientific biodiversity data for decision-making, research endeavours and public use. GBIF endorses both open source software 
and open data access.

In terms of structure, GBIF is a dynamic, growing partnership of countries, organisations, institutions and individuals working together to mobilise 
scientific biodiversity data. 

GBIF is also a network of data publishers who retain ownership and 
control of the data they share. Linked datasets provide a more robust representation of biodiversity than any single dataset. 

In this framework, GBIF develops software tools to make possible to 
easily integrate biodiversity data from heterogeneous sources using common 
standards and protocols. One of these tools is the GBIF Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) that this user manual refers to.

The GBIF IPT is an open source, Java (TM) based web application 
that connects and serves three types of biodiversity data: taxon primary 
occurrence data, taxon checklists and general resource metadata. The data 
registered in a GBIF IPT instance is connected to the GBIF distributed 
network and made available for public consultation and use. Several factors 
have motivated the development of this new tool: 

- the limitations of the existing systems to publish primary biodiversity 
occurrence records that use tools and protocols that were not designed 
to transfer big amounts of records (DiGIR, TAPIR, ABCD); 
- the need to decentralise and speed up the process of indexing biodiversity occurrence datasets; 
- the need to offer additional benefits and services to the data publishers to encourage data publication (i.e. public web interface to 
browse/expose (meta)data, mapping services); 
- the need to offer data quality assessment tools to data publishers and 
generalise data cleaning habits; 
- the need to increase data exchange using globally accepted formats 
(i.e. OGC web services); 
- the need for easy ways to monitor data access and use for the different 
resources connected to the GBIF Network; 
- the lack of appropriate tools to publish other types of biodiversity data, 
such as names checklists and dataset metadata; 
- existing requests to facilitate and automate dataset registration with 
the GBIF Network; 
- the requirement to implement (and assign if needed) Universal Unique 
Identifiers (UUIDs) associated to all published elements to increase 
interoperability in the GBIF Network; 


The GBIF IPT, as an open source pro ject, is made freely available for both 
those who wish to use it to publish their data and those who wish to participate in its development, documentation and helpdesk. This is a list of the 
current online resources related to the GBIF IPT: 

- the GBIF IPT mailing list: http://lists.gbif.org/mailman/listinfo/ipt/; 
- the GBIF IPT test installation (for testing purposes): http://ipt.gbif.org/; 
- the GBIF IPT code site: http://code.google.com/p/gbif-providertoolkit/. 


+ General specifications +

The GBIF Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) is an Open source Java based web application. It embeds its own database, is easily customisable and is multilingual. It has a user management feature based on roles, which allows for multiple data managers to share a common instance.

It connects and serves three types of data : taxon primary occurrence data, taxon checklists and general resource metadata. The IPT manages multiple data sources and has several upload options: relational database management systems or tab files. It does not however accept manual entries (except for individual metadata descriptions).

Its public web interface allows for data browsing and full text search. It also offers customised details pages for the three types of data, with specific functionality for each type (i.e. density maps, metadata edition). 

The IPT manages Universally Unique IDentifiers (UUID), recycling existing IDs or providing new ones, as appropriate. It also manages technical metadata about the installation and allows for an easy setup of Google Analytics for usage statistics. 


+ Installation +

++ Requirements ++

The IPT will run on any of the most widespread Operating Systems (Linux, Mac OS (TM), MS Windows (TM)) provided that:

- Java (TM) runtime environment (http://java.sun.com/) version 5 or more is installed; 
- A web server with a servlet container, such as Apache Tomcat (http://tomcat.apache.org) or Jetty (http://jetty.mortbay.com/), is installed and connected to the Internet.


++ Brief overview of Java and Tomcat installation and configuration ++

It is beyond the scope of this manual to provide detailed installation and configuration instructions for the virtual machine and the server. Here is a quick overview for MS Windows (TM) and Mac OS (TM) computers.

+++ Java +++

Mac OS X (TM) already comes complete with a fully configured and ready-to-use Java runtime environment. 

For MS Windows (TM) machines, follow these steps to install it: 

+ Download the Java 2 Standard Edition Runtime Environment (JRE), release version 5.0 or later, from http://java.sun.com/j2se.
+ Install the JRE according to the instructions included with the release.
+ Set an environment variable named JRE_HOME to the pathname of the directory into which you installed the JRE, e.g. c:\jre5.0:
 + Open the //Control Panel// and click the //System// icon. 
 + Go to the //Advanced// pane and click the //Environment variables// button. 
 + In the //System variables// section, click //New//. In the //Variable name// box, type JRE_HOME; in the //Variable value// box, type the path to the JRE e.g. C:\Program Files\Java\jre6
	
	
+++ Application server +++

The IPT should run in any compliant java application server using Java 1.5. Tomcat 5.5 is recommended for the installation. It was also successfully tested on Tomcat 6 and Jetty.

The application server will need a rather large amount of memory allocated as the IPT runs a full database. It is recommended to increase the server's available memory to at least 1GB (general instructions below). 

++++ Tomcat installation ++++

+ Download a binary distribution of Tomcat from http://tomcat.apache.org/download-55.cgi.
+ Unpack the binary distribution into a location of your choice (e.g. C:\apache-tomcat-5.5.27)
+ Open a command prompt window and navigate to the installation folder.
+ Mac OS only: some files need to have their permissions adapted: type “//sudo chmod 775 *//” at the command line. You will be asked your administrative password.
+ go to the //bin// folder and execute startut.bat (Window) or startup.sh (Mac OS). A new Tomcat window will open. You need to keep this window open.


++++ Tomcat configuration ++++

Tomcat comes with very little allocated memory. In order to increase performance, this amount should be increased depending on the amount of physical memory on the server. If the server has at least 2GB of RAM, the available memory should be increased to 1GB. For more information on how to do it, see the following links:
- http://explanatorygap.net/2005/03/06/configuring-tomcat-under-os-x-server-for-more-memory/
- http://wiki.apache.org/tomcat/FAQ/Memory


++ IPT Installation ++

+ Download the web archive file (ipt-1.0.war at the time of writing) from the project downloads page: http://code.google.com/p/gbif-providertoolkit/downloads/list
+ Rename it to ipt.war and copy it into the webapps folder of the Tomcat installation directory.
+ Launch Tomcat:
 + open a command prompt (MS Windows(TM)) or a terminal window (Mac OS (TM)) 
 + navigate to the Tomcat installation folder
 + go to the bin folder and execute startup.bat (windows) or startup.sh (Mac OS)
+ The IPT can then be accessed in any browser at http://localhost:8080/ipt/


++ Geoserver Installation ++

GeoServer (http://geoserver.org/) is an open source software server written in Java that allows users to share and edit geospatial data. It is used to run IPT geographic web services via a plugin that can access the IPT cache. If there is already a geoserver installation on the server, only the plugin needs to be installed. If there is no such installation, a geoserver archive bundled with the plugin is provided.

+++ Geoserver and bundled plugin installation +++

This installation is required if the Geoserver is not yet installed on the machine.

+ Download the zipped archive from the project downloads page;
+ Extract it into the Tomcat webapps folder and rename it as “geoserver”;
+ Restart Tomcat (shutdown.bat then startup.bat on MS Windows (TM), shutdown.sh and startup.sh on Mac OS(TM)).


+++ Plugin installation +++

If the Geoserver is already installed on the server, only the plugin needs to be installed.

+ Downoad the jar file from the project downloads page;
+ Install it in your existing Geoserver installation, in the geoserver/WEB-INF/lib folder;
+ Restart Tomcat (shutdown.bat then startup.bat on MS Windows (TM), shutdown.sh and startup.sh on Mac OS (TM)) .


++ Geoserver Configuration ++

In order to allow the IPT and the Geoserver to communicate to one another, it is necessary to define the IPT Base Directory. It is done by: 
- navigating with your web browser to http://localhost:8080/ipt/;
- logging in with username //admin// and password //admin//;
- navigating to //Settings// > //Settings// > //IPT Base Directory//;
- pressing the //Update Geoserver// button.


This procedure will be explained with more details in the //Configuration// section of this document.

For more information about the Geoserver, please refer to its own manual: http://geoserver.org/

++ Mac OS X (TM) test installation ++

A standalone version without any dependencies is provided for Mac OS X. It is very easy to install as it only requires a simple click and is very convenient to test the IPT. It should not however be used for production purposes.
The disk image can be downloaded at the time of writing from the following address: ftp://ftp.gbif.org/projects/ipt/downloads/ipt-1.0b.8.dmg

+ Configuration +

Once the IPT has been installed, it is accessible in a web browser at the following URL: http://localhost:8080/ipt/

To be able to configure the software, one must login as administrator by clicking on the //Login// button in the main menu and entering a username and password. By default, the adminstrative username is //admin// and the password is also //admin//.

Once logged in, a new //Admin// section appears in the menu. The subsequent drop-down menu offers the following choices:

- Settings
- Extensions
- Thesaurus
- View Users
- Current Users
- Active Datasources
- Background Tasks


++ Settings ++

The Settings section is divided in three configuration options:

- Settings
- Organisation
- IPT Instance


+++ Settings +++

The Settings page allows the administrator to define a number of parameters that are essential for the IPT to function correctly.

++++ IPT Base URL ++++

This is the URL of the IPT. It is filled in by default with the local URL (http://localhost:8080/ipt). ). In order to make the IPT instance accessible by distant users on a network, the parameter should be changed to the networked URL (e.g. http://67.233.45.122:8080/ipt or http://exemple.com:8080/ipt).

++++ IPT Base Directory ++++

This field defines the location of the IPT in the file system. It is filled in by default and does not need to be changed. It is followed by a button that needs to be clicked in order for the Geoserver to know where to access the IPT. If the IPT is moved or renamed, it is necessary to renew the location by pressing the //Update Geoserver// button. 

++++ config.log4jFilename ++++

[**//What is it? Should it be there? Not with this name in any case.//**]

++++ Google Maps API Key ++++

In order to use the the Google Maps (TM) feature embeded in the IPT pages, it is necessary to own a //Google Maps API Key//. This free key is specific to a server and needs to be requested for each public installation. The administrator can get such a key for free by clicking on the “Get Google Maps API key” link and following instructions provided by Google.

+++ Geoserver Settings +++

The Settings page also allows the administrator to define some parameters for the Geoserver. For more information about the Geoserver, see its users guide: http://geoserver.org/display/GEOSDOC/Users+Guide

++++ Base URL ++++

The Base URL is the URL of the Geoserver. It is filled in by default with the local Geoserver URL (http://localhost:8080/geoserver). In order to make the Geoserver accessible by distant users on a network, the parameter should be changed to the networked URL (e.g. http://67.233.45.122:8080/geoserver or http://exemple.com:8080/geoserver).

++++ Data Directory ++++

The Data Directory is the location in the server file system of the directory where data reside. It is filled in by default but can be modified manually.

++++ Admin User and password ++++

By default, the administrative username is //admin// and the administrative password is //geoserver//. These parameters //must// be changed if the server is to be used for production and/or accessible to the public.

+++ Organisation +++

This page allows the administrator to define the GBIF organisation hosting the IPT installation. It is necessary to define the organisation in order to register the IPT. The GBIF keeps a directory of organisations, resources and services and a password is necessary to register the organisation or to access its data.

The following fields must filled in:

: Title 
  this is the full name of the organisation
: Organisation Identifier
  this is a code provided automatically by the GBIF once the organisation is registered filling and sending this form
: GBIF Node 
  GBIF Participant Node that endorses the publication of the data in this installation to be connected to the GBIF Network
: Organisation password 
  this password can be used by other members of the organisation to retrieve the information
: Contact Name 
  Name of the contact person
: Contact Email 
  Email of the contact person
: Homepage 
  URL of the organisation's website
: Description 
  Description of the organisation
: Cancel / Save / Register 
  The three buttons allow the administrator to respectively delete what he just typed, saved the information in the form or register the organisation with the GBIF. When does so, he will receive an Organisation Identifier that will be automatically filled in the right field.


+++ IPT Instance +++

This page allows the administrator to define some parameters regarding the IPT instance that is being run. The information filled in on this page will be used to populate the homepage of this IPT instance.

: Organisation Identifier 
  this is the code provided automatically by GBIF during the organisation registration process
: Title 
  this is the name given to the IPT instance. It can be the name of an organisation, a project, a natural history collection, etc.
: Contact Name 
  Name of the contact person
: Contact Email 
  Email of the contact person
: Homepage 
  URL of the organisation's website
: Latitude and Longitude 
  the coordinates will be used to display the right portion of the Google Maps.
: Description 
  description of the organisation
: Description Image URL 
  Image used on the front page of the IPT instance


++ Extensions ++

Extensions allow for serving additional data types, such as multiple identifications or descriptive data about species.

The page provides a list of available extensions and shows whether they are installed or not. Each extension can be installed or uninstalled by clicking on its name.

By default, available extensions are:

- ResourceRelationship 
- SampleAttribute
- EventAttribute 
- Identification 
- Description 
- Multimedia 
- CommonName 
- Distribution 
- MaterialExamined 
- DarwinCore 
- Taxon 
- VernacularName


The user can get more information about an extension and install it by clicking on its name.

It is possible to define custom extensions, but this is not automated process with this the 1.0 version of the IPT.

++ Thesaurus ++

Thesaurus vocabularies allow for specifying controlled vocabularies to help standardise concepts. This page shows a list of the available thesauri. More information can be obtained by clicking on the names under the Vocabulary column.

By default, available thesauri are:

- ISO 639-1 Languages 
- Country Codes 
- Language Vocabulary 
- Darwin Core Type Vocabulary
- Nomenclatural Codes
- Taxonomic Ranks


It is possible to define custom vocabularies, but this is not automated process with version 1.0 of the IPT.

++ View Users ++

This page allows the administrator to manage users. There are three users roles: //administrator//, //manager// and //user//.

The page displays the list of users their usernames, full names and emails. By clicking on the username, one can edit the user profile. One can also export the list in different formats (CSV, Excel, XML and PDF).

The page also gives the opportunity to add a new user through the //Add// button at the bottom of the page.

+++ User Profile +++

The User Profile page allows the administrator to add a new user or to edit or delete an existing user.

To add a new user, the following fields must be filled in:

: username
  user's username
: password 
  needs to be filled in twice for confirmation
: e-mail
: password hint
  will be e-mailed to the user who forgot his password
: first name
  user's first name
: last name
  user's last name

The administrator must also apply some settings to the account:

: Enabled 
  the account is enabled and ready to be used
: Expired 
  the account is not valid anymore and cannot be used to login to the IPT
: Locked 
  the account is locked and cannot be used to login to the IPT
: Password Expired 
  the user must change his password next time he logs in.


Finally, the administrator must assign one or several roles to the account. The following roles are available:

: ROLE_ADMIN 
 the user is given administrative rights and has access to all the features of the IPT, in particular its technical settings. He can also manage the data recorded in the IPT. The administrator supersedes all the other roles and can do anything any other role can do.
: ROLE_MANAGER 
  the user is given manager rights and can manage the data recorded in the IPT. He can create, edit, delete, or publish data.
: ROLE_USER 
  the user role is the most basic role of the IPT. The user can explore the site and browse the published information. He can also annotate resources. [**//Is it so?, I have not managed to do it.//**]
  
  
A visitor that is not logged in is considered to be an //anonymous user//. Such a user can explore the site and browse the published information.

++ Resources ++

This page displays a list of all resources that have been uploaded to the IPT. 

In order to find the right resource, the administrator can order the list by clicking on the table headers. Resources can be ordered by title, date of modification, UUID or Type. A second click on the header will invert the order.

The administrator can get more details about eache resource by clicking on its title. The administrator can then modify the UUID, the contact name and contact email. He also has access to the registered services. [**//What are they?//**]

++ Current Users ++

This page displays a list of the currently logged in users on the IPT. The administrator is offered the possibility to send them an e-mail.

++ Active Datasources ++

This page displays a list of all the active data sources in the IPT.

+ Resources Management +

++ Data Types ++

+++ Taxon Primary Occurence Data +++

  

+++ Taxonomic Checklists +++
   

+++ Resource Metadata +++

++ Resource Creation ++


New resources are created by a manager (or an administrator) on the //Manage// page.

The manager chooses which resource type to create by clicking on the corresponding link in the //Resource Actions// menu: //New Occurence Resource//, //New Checklist Resource// or //New Metadata Resource//.


++ Resource Metadata ++

When the resource has been created, the manager can its metadata.

+++ Basic Metadata +++

The first step is to basically describe the dataset that will be published. The manager must fill in the following fields:

: Title
  Title of the resource
: Type
  Type of data:
    - Checklist

  Name of the contact person
: Contact Email
  Email of the contact person
: Upload logo
  The manager can upload a logo associated with the resource. The logo must be a squared image 68 pixels wide.
: Description
  Description of the resource


Once the fields have been filled in, the manager can save the form, the resource is then created and can be accessed later on in the //Manage// section.

+++ Resource Originator +++

This section describes the originator of the resource, i.e. the person responsible for the information entered in the IPT. The following fields are to be filled in:

- Resource Language (mandatory field)
- First Name (mandatory field)
- Last Name (mandatory field)
- Organisation
- Position
- Phone
- Email (mandatory field)
- Homepage
- Address
- Postal Code
- City
- Province
- Country (mandatory field)


+++ Geographic Coverage +++

In this section, the manager can describe the geographic coverage of the resource by drawing it on a map.

===== Using the map =====

The manager can navigate on the map by clicking and dragging the cursor around and can zoom using the scale on the left of the map. Double-clicking somewhere on the map will zoom and center the map on this point.

===== Creating a new area =====

The manager must click on the grey //select area// button in the top right corner of the map. He can then click and drag his mouse to select an area. Only one area can be created per map.

===== Description =====

The manager can describe the geographic coverage in the box below the map.


+++ Taxonomic Coverage +++

++++ Taxonomic Metadata ++++


: General Taxonomic Coverage Description 

: Taxonomic Keywords 


++++ Lowest Common Taxon ++++

: Scientific Name (mandatory field)

: Common Name 

: Rank (mandator field)



+++ Temporal Coverage +++

The manger must fill in the temporal information of the resource: start and end date. The dates must be filled in using the format "YYYY/MM/DD" (e.g. 2003/04/22). If the resource covers a single day, the manager can enter a single date and check the corresponding checkbox.

+++ General Keywords +++

In this section, the manager can indicate keywords for the resource. The keywords must be separated by a comma. 

+++ IPRights +++

On this page, he manager can indicate the information related to intellectual property rights (IPRights) attached to the resource.

The GBIF supports the use of the Creative Commons license, which allow the originator to keep his copyright but allow people to copy and distribute at conditions specified by the originator. For more information, see http://creativecommons.org/license/.

: Purpose

: Maintenance

: IPRights



+++ Research Project +++

If the resource is linked to a specific reseach project, the manager can describe it in this section.

: Title

: Project Lead Organisation

: Abstract

: Funding

: Study Area Description
 
: Design Description



+++ Methods +++

: Methods
: Sampling Description
: Quality Control


++ Resource Configuration (occurences and checklists only) ++

Once the resource has been created, the manager must define a data source and map properties.

+++ Source Data +++

Data sources can be of two kinds in the IPT: File Data Sources or SQL Data Sources. The manager can define as many data sources as he wants, but it is necessary to define at least one.

++++ File Data Sources ++++

In order to define a file data source, the manager must upload a text file with a single header row and with tab separated values. Such //tab delimited text files// are easily created from any spreadsheet software or database management systems.

Once the file has been uploaded, the manager can define whether the first row of the file is a header or not, by checking or unchecking the //column headers// box and pressing the //save// button. All the data fields will then be named after this header. If not set, generic names (col001, col002, col003 and so on) will be used.

When done adding data sources, the manager can press the //Next// button to go to the //Property Mappings// page.

++++ SQL Data Sources ++++

In order to define a SQL data source, the manager must first configure a database connection, then add some SQL select statements to create views on the data.

Pressing the //Edit// button on the //Source Data// page will bring the manager to the //SQL Settings// page. This is the page where the database connection will be defined. To this effect, the manager needs to know the database type, the database connection URL, the database user and the database password. He also needs to make sure that the right Java DataBase Connection (JDBC) driver is installed. Fortunately, most of them are already bundled with the IPT. It is furthermore easy to add new ones, by downloading them and adding the //jar// file to the ITP //lib// folder and restarting the application server.

The //SQL Settings// page also gives a list of important parameters for the most used databases.

: Database Type
  the manager must define the type of the database holding the data. If his particular system is not in the list, he can use a generic ODBC or choose the //other// option and define his own driver class.
: Database Connection URL
  the manager must fill in the URL of the database connection. the format to be used is explained in the second part of the //SQL Settings// page. The manager will generally need to know the host or server (//localhost// if the database is on the same machine as the IPT), the port (default ports are given for most used databases), and the name of the database (to be asked to the database administrator). For instance, for a local MySQL database called //test//, the database connection URL will be jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/test.
: Database user
  the username of a database user with SELECT rights
: Database password
  the corresponding password


Once all the fields have been filled in, the manager can //save// the form. He will then be brought back to the //Source Data// page where he can add more data sources or press the //Next// button to go to the //Property Mappings// page.

+++ Property Mappings +++

Data in the IPT is organised along a star schema: a fixed table holds Darwin Core terms and is linked to a number of extension tables (in a one-to-many relationship) that can be optionally configured and defined by the IPT administrator (see //Extensions// section above). Each extension can hold multiple records for a single core record, e.g. there can be many images for a species or occurrence.

The //Property Mappings// page displays a list of the existing mappings, that can be edited, and gives the possibility to add new mappings.

When done adding or editing mappings, the manager can press the //Next// button to go to the //Cache// page.

++++ Your Existing Mappings ++++

When defining new data sources, the IPT will automatically map those fields whose name fits a Darwin Core term or the field name of an installed extension. These mappings can be viewed or modified by pressing the //Edit// button.

The page is split in three parts:

: ID properties
  A list of all properties related to the ID **??????????**
: Property Mappings
  A list of all the selected extension or core properties that have been mapped to a data source field.
: Available Properties
  A list of all the selected extension or core properties that have not been mapped to a data source field.


===== ID Properties =====

 **??????????**

: Source ID for record
: GUID for record
: Link to record details
: Link template with <ID> placeholder


The //save// button will save the information that was entered in the fields. The //Done// button brings the manager back to the main //Property Mappings// page **without saving the information**.

===== Property Mappings =====

**Will add screenshots to clarify**

Each Darwin Core or extension property mapped to a data source field is displayed in the list, followed by the data source field. This field can be changed as the drop-down menu displays the full list of fields of a given data source.

===== Available Properties =====

This section displays a list of the selected extension or core properties not yet mapped to a data source field. They are grouped in subsections that can be expanded by clicking on the green arrow. To map an available property to a data source field, the manager must click on the said property that will then move to the //property mappings// section. The manager can then choose which data source field should be mapped to it (by selecting it in the drop-down).

++++ Add New Mapping ++++

To add a new mapping, the manager must first choose what extension will be mapped to which data source, then press the //Add// button.

The page is split in three parts:

: ID properties
  A list of all properties related to the ID **??????????**
: Available Properties
  A list of all the selected extension or core properties that have not been mapped to a data source field.
: Property Mappings
  A list of all the selected extension or core properties that have already been mapped to a data source field.


===== ID Properties =====

 **??????????**

: Source ID for record
: GUID for record
: Link to record details
: Link template with <ID> placeholder


The //save// button will save the information that was entered in the fields. The //Done// button brings the manager back to the main //Property Mappings// page **without saving the information**.

===== Available Properties =====

This section displays a list of the selected extension or core properties not yet mapped to a data source field. They are grouped in subsections that can be expanded by clicking on the green arrow. To map an available property to a data source field, the manager must click on the said property that will then move to the //property mappings// section. 

===== Property Mappings =====

After having added some properties to  the list, the manager can choose which data source field should be mapped to them (by selecting it in the drop-down).

When done, the //Save// button should be pressed before the //Done// button.

+++ Cache +++

The cache page allows the manager to actually import the data into the IPT. This is done by pressing the //Upload// button. Depending on the amount of data, the operation can take a long time. Once done, the IPT displays a confirmation message.

The cache can be rebuilt at any time when the manager wants to update the information with new or updated sources.
