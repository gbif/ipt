# NOMENCLATURAL STATUS VOCABULARY
#
# Terms for the nomenclatural status of a name. 
# In case of binary name relationships synonyms point to the accepted second name.
# So the taxon with taxstatus="synonym" and nomstatus="orthographic variant" points to the accepted name via its acceptedID
# 
# Am I correct in stating that the nomenclatural status of the name only refers to an attribute of a name and not a relationship with another name.
