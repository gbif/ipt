  Description:
    Abstract:
      This data/metadata record is a total fabrication to be used in
      demonstrating the use of the CSC online metadata builder.
      IT HAS NO RELATIONSHIP TO ANY REAL DATA SET.
    Purpose:
      To illustrate the replacement of text chunks that will change from
      one record to the next with a tag.  MetaScribe will provide the user
      with an input field for each distinctly named tag.

  Use_Constraints:
    Data set is not for use in litigation. While efforts have
    been made to ensure that these data are accurate and
    reliable within the state of the art, NOAA, cannot assume
    liability for any damages, or misrepresentations, caused
    by any inaccuracies in the data, or as a result of the data
    to be used on a particular system. NOAA makes no warranty,
    expressed or implied, nor does the fact of distribution
    constitute such a warranty.
    Additional Use Constraints:
    None
  Native_Data_Set_Environment: ERDAS Imagine 8.4 on SUN Ultra 60, UNIX 5.8
Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      An explanation of the accuracy of the identification of the
      entities and assigment of values....  This work was done very
      carefully.  The instruments were calibrated to some specification
      to achieve some base accuracy level.  Calculations performed on
      the raw data made use of least unit measure and significant digit
      principles to report any derive values.  and so on.....
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    Tests for logical consistency indicate that all row and
    column positions in the selected latitude/longitude
    window contain data. Conversion and integration with vec-
    tor files indicates that all positions are consistent
    with earth coordinates covering the same area. Attribute
    files appear to be logically consistent. Examining the
    change matrix for logical fallacies, we find, for example,
    that a very small number of pixels changed from developed
    land to any other category.
  Completeness_Report:
    The classification scheme comprehensively includes all
    anticipated land covers, and all pixels have been
    classified.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        Precision corrected images were purchased from the EROS
        Data Center in UTM NAD27 meters to an RMSE +/- 0.5 pixels.
    Vertical_Positional_Accuracy:
      Vertical_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        There was no terrain
        correction in the georeferencing procedure.

        These Landsat data were purchased from the USGS EROS
        Data Center.  The data had been previously radio-
        metrically and geometrically corrected (level-1G) by
        the EROS data center.

      Process_Description:
        Large chunks of this section, as with all
        sections, have been deleted to shorten this example
        template.  The technical information in this record
        CAN NOT be used in any manner.  It has been totally
        corrupted.  The processing steps for each State Name Land Cover
        Change product are intricately associated. Each
        database is the result of many processing steps with
        numerous iterations for each step. The output of
        one processing step or database is often the
        input data for another processing step. A brief
        description of the processing steps used in the
        land cover classification of the this project
        follows.  Large chunks of this section, as with all
        sections, have been deleted to shorten this example
        template.  The technical information in this record
        CAN NOT be used in any manner.  It has been totally
