This Germplasm Extension is modelled directly from the Multi-Crop Passport standard and the (proposed) EPGRIS3 trait data standard for characterisation and evaluation data (C&E). The purpose of building this germplasm extension for Darwin Core is for the development of an application schema for the GBIF IPT data publishing toolkit. The DwC Germplasm extension could also stimulate a process of further improved compatibility of the terms for documentation of germplasm and the terms and concepts used for documentation in other sub-domains of biodiversity informatics.",
