# Introduction (to IPT translation):
#
# The preferred way of translating the IPT is using https://crowdin.com/project/gbif-ipt
# New volunteers are always welcome. To join, just login to Crowdin and request to join the IPT project.
#
# This file is in UTF-8 encoding, the IPT build process will produce a .properties file in ISO-8859-1
# (the encoding that must be used for properties files) with Unicode escapes.
#
# To developers, please note:
#
# When working on this file, please maintain sensible groupings (contexts) within this file. Also please consider ways
# to simplify the lives of translators, such as by parsing generic messages out of specific sections for better reuse.

admin.config.setup.title=IPT setup
admin.config.setup.welcome=To use the IPT you must select a directory where the IPT will store its configuration information â called the IPT data directory.
admin.config.setup.instructions=Please select an empty, writable folder or an existing IPT data directory. Do not select a folder that is vulnerable to other processes, such as /tmp, which may be emptied on a system restart. This folder should be backed up regularly in keeping with a disaster recovery plan.
admin.config.setup.examples=For example, use a path such as "C\:\\datadir" for Windows environments or "/srv/datadir" for Unix-like environments such as Linux, Mac OS X.
admin.config.setup.disclaimerPart1=Since IPT version 2.2, publishers are required to assign one of three machine-readable rights declarations to their data: CC0 1.0, CC-BY 4.0 or CC-BY-NC 4.0.
admin.config.setup.disclaimerPart2=GBIF implemented and enforced this requirement across the network in 2016. If you are unable to choose one of the three options, and your dataset contains occurrence data, you will not be able to register your dataset with GBIF or make it globally discoverable through GBIF.org. For background on this decision, <a href="https://www.gbif.org/terms/licences" target="_blank">click here</a>.

admin.config.setup2.mode.title=IPT Mode
admin.config.setup2.mode.help=Select the mode you would like to run the IPT in. The IPT mode decides whether or not the hosted resources will be indexed for public search access by GBIF. GBIF recommends IPT administrators try Test mode first in order to understand the registration process, and then reinstall in Production mode for formal data publishing. <strong>Warning</strong>: for a given installation, this selection is final and cannot be changed later on. To switch from test to production mode or vice versa, you will have to reinstall your IPT and repeat any configurations you made.

manage.resource.migrate.failed.duplicate.help=If you are trying to replace a registered resource that already exists in your IPT, the other resource has to be deleted first. In this case, please notify helpdesk@gbif.org that the resource has been replaced, and not deleted, since deleting a registered resource causes it to be flagged as deleted in the GBIF Registry.

manage.mapping.title=Mapping Source Data
manage.mapping.intro1=Mapping source data {0} to {1} {2}
manage.mapping.intro=Each column of the source data can be mapped to one or more fields in this extension. You can also specify a static value for each field that is used for all records, or define a translation between values from your source data and the value used.<br/><br/>Note the column in your source that holds a unique key for every record/row should be mapped to the identifier. If you want to map other sources, this identifier is required and will be used to link your source rows together.<br/><br/>Also a filter can be used to include only records that match a criterion set for one of the source data fields.

manage.mapping.info=A filter excludes matching records from the generated archive. For example, specify &quot;ColumnA IsNotNull&quot; to include only records that have some value in ColumnA.<br /><br />A filter can be very useful if the same extension is mapped several times to do pivots. If you have two columns for vernacular names, one for English, one for Spanish, in the same source you can map the same source twice to the vernacular names extension. Map one of the two columns for each mapping and set the filter on the same column to IsNotNull. That way only extension records that actually have a vernacular name will end up in the final data file.

To reuse an existing DOI, enter it into the citation identifier field in the resource metadata. If a resource is publicly available and reserved a DOI, the next publication will result in a new major version and the DOI will be registered. Otherwise if a resource is private and reserved a DOI, the next publication will result in a new minor version of the resource and the DOI will NOT be registered. Be aware that until a DOI is registered you can still delete it.
manage.overview.publishing.doi.reserve.new.help=You can reserve a new DOI for a published resource that has already been assigned a DOI.
