# CODING CONVENTIONS #

### Guice ###
IptModule contains wiring, but for interfaces these are annotated directly with @ImplementedBy(ConfigManagerImpl.class)
 
### Struts2 ###
BaseAction:
 supplies the AppConfig, implements session aware and gives access to current user, implements a simpler TextProvider which is faster than the native struts2 one. 


FormAction:
 this helper action class simplifies working with forms.
 For modifying instance data always use POST, never GET.
 The "input" resultname is used to show the form. We can therefore use the standard validation interceptor which uses the input result when data doesnt validate.
 The "success" result is called when the form submit succeeded. In many cases this should simply be a redirect to another, often the corresponding list, action.

 The action implements preparable, request aware and the execute method.
   execute: FormAction determines if a POST or GET is used and calls save (POST), delete (POST + delete=true) or nothing (GET). 
 If any other action values need to be set you can override load() or this method - but remember to call super.execute().
   prepare: the "id" parameter of the request object is stored in the action and the load() method which should in most cases be overriden is called

 Most full actions for modifying entities should override the following methods:
   prepare(): load existing values based on "id" parameter and request object
   save(): persist data AFTER the params interceptor did its job
   delete(): this method is called when a POST with a "delete=anything_but_null" parameter is received
  If the id given does not exist you can set the "notFound" property to true in any of the above methods. FormAction will then return a 404 result name

Validation:
  prefer to implement the validate() method of an action (instead of using xml validation definitions).
  See SetupAction as an example.
  Validation requires an "input" result name that shows the form when the form was not valid.
  using the simple theme we also need to declare where to render the validation feedback: http://struts.apache.org/2.1.8/docs/fielderror.html
