# How to Translate

## Introduction
The IPT user interface and user manual both need internationalisation. Internationalisation is a community effort, and everyone is welcome to join.

## How To Translate the User Interface
The preferred way of translating the user interface is using an online translation tool called [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/gbif-ipt). To join, just login to [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/gbif-ipt), select the language you would like to translate, and hit the 'Join' button. A manager will handle your request, and add you to the translation team. After that, you can get started translating. Most people find Crowdin incredibly easy and intuitive to use. For help using Crowdin, you can always refer to their [Knowledge Base](https://support.crowdin.com/for-translators/getting-started-translators/interface-overview).

## How To Translate the User Manual
The easiest way to translate the user manual is through the GitHub wiki. Please email helpdesk@gbif.org to get added to the project with sufficient privileges to edit the wiki. Don't worry, a project manager will help you get started.

For new languages, a project manager needs to create a new directory under ipt.wiki using the 2-letter ISO 639-1 code as the directory name, e.g. ipt.wiki/es. Then the project manager will create a home page, table of contents and copy the English wiki page corresponding to the User Manual to this directory, e.g. IPT2ManualNotes_ES.wiki.md. That page can then be translated/edited directly through the wiki. Additional files can simply be added to the new directory. 

Screenshots throughout the user manual should show the translated language. Screenshots are committed to a separate repository in ipt.wiki called gbif-ipt-docs again using the 2-letter ISO 639-1 code to store screenshots for that language, e.g. gbif-ipt-docs/ipt2/v23/es.
