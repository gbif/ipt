RANK	ABBREVIATION	DESCRIPTION
#
Candidate	cand.	Candidatus' rank is proposed in bacteriology for putative taxa, which could not yet be studied sufficiently to warrant the creation of a name with a known rank.Murray, R.G.E. & Schleifer, K.H.: Taxonomic notes: a proposal for recording the properties of putative taxa of procaryotes. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol., 1994, 44, 174-176). 
Infraspecific Taxon	tax. infrasp.	 infraspecific tax. of undefined rank -- Undefined ranksusing either no rank identifier in botany, or using greek letters or symbols like stars, crosses) occur in very old publications. Most frequently these are to be interpreted as varieties, but occasionally they are forms or subspeciessee Stearn, W.T. 1957: Species plantarumFacsimile); Introduction. 1. London, p. 90-95, 160-161, 163). The interpretation of these cases requires taxonomic knowledge that may not be available at the time when data are parsed. Such lack of knowledge can be expressed using this rank identifier. 
Special Form	f. sp.	The ICBN does not formally cover formae specialisart. 4, note 3). However, because of the economic importance of pathogenic f. sp., and since it is common practice to handle them as if the code would applyi. e. priority usually observed, name quoted with author they are included here. 
Subsubform	subsubfm.	subsubform 
Subform	subfm.	subform 
Form	fm.	Form, race, variety are not subject to regulation in zoology; see ICZN Article 1.3.4 
Sub-Sub-Variety	subsubvar.	sub-sub-variety 
Sub-Variety	subvar.	sub-variety 
Variety	var.	Form, race, variety are not subject to regulation in zoology; see ICZN Article 1.3.4 Examples: Pinus nigra var. caramanica= "P. nigra subsp. nigra var. caramanica"; Taxus baccata var. variegata 
Patho-Variety	pathovar.	patho-variety 
Bio-Variety	biovar.	bio-variety 
Infraspecies	infrasp.	infraspecies 
Subspecific Aggregate	aggr.	subspecific aggregate= group, complex) -- A loosely defined group of subspecies. Zoology: "Aggregate - a group of subspecies within a species. An aggregate may be denoted by a group name interpolated in parentheses."
Subspecies	subsp.	subspecies -- Examples: Pinus nigra subsp. nigra Homo sapiens sapiens 
Species	sp.	species -- Examples: Taxus baccata, Homo sapiens 
Species Aggregate	aggr.	A loosely defined group of species. Zoology: "Aggregate - a group of species, other than a subgenus, within a genus. An aggregate may be denoted by a group name interpolated in parentheses." -- The Berlin/MoreTax model notes: "[these] aren't taxonomic ranks but cirumscriptions because on the one hand they are necessary for the concatenation of the fullname and on the other hand they are necessary for distinguishing the aggregate or species group from the microspecies." Compare subspecific aggregate for a group of subspecies within a species!
Infrageneric Taxon	tax. infragen.	infrageneric tax. of undefined rank -- A name that appear between a genus name and a species epitheton and is not clearly marked as series or section, or other may be assigned to this rank until the true rank can be assigned by a taxonomic expert.

Suprageneric Taxon	tax. supragen.	suprageneric tax. of undefined rank -- This value indicates that the rank of a name is unknown. Compare "incertae sedis" which is commonly used as a replacement for a taxon to group all taxa whose position in the classification or phylogenetic tree is uncertain.
Cultivar	cult.	cultivar -- The epithet is usually output in single quotes and may contain multiple words, see ICBN ¬ß28. Examples: Taxus baccata 'Variegata', Juniperus √É‚Äîpfitzeriana 'Wilhelm Pfitzer'; Magnolia 'Elizabeth'= a hybrid, no species epithet). 
Convar	convar.	Used in cultivated plantsICNCP but deprecated, see 'Some notes on problems of taxonomy and nomenclature of cultivated plants' by J. Ochsmann, http://www.genres.de/IGRREIHE/IGRREIHE/DDD/22-08.pdf
