  * Addressed the issue that when putting error messages during contact validation, vertical space is not enough for the message container. This was introduced when trying to fix the halfcolumn shifting issue on Firefox for the country select list. Limit height was used for halfcolumn. Now introducing a class "countryList" to only limit the country select list. See cmn 100 of issue 878.

  * This commit cleans up and refactors the RegistryManager interface and implementation using the new GBDRS client. The client has decent test coverage but we don't have good test coverage for integration with the IPT yet.
  * Additional test coverage for the GBRDS client, including new testing for the extension support.
  * Adding support for reading GBIF Extensions from the GBRDS. This comes into play for the IPT when listing all extensions in RegistryManager.
  * extensions & schema moved to registry project
  * extensions & schema moved to registry project
  * This commit adds support for the methods required by the OrganisationAPI, ServiceAPI, and ResourceAPI to implement IPT registry interactions.
  * Deleting Registry client in preparation of moving in refactored implementation.
  * Refactored a few method names.
  * Code cleanup and a modified interface where requests are executed for responses with typed results. Still preliminary pending a design discussion with Tim, José, and John.
  * Added support for recTotal in pure metaData resources so that they can be displayed in Explore and Home views after being published.
  * Fixes issue 337.
  * Fixes issue 330.
  * This commit addressed issue 334 (erroneous rows fixed, and 'contains headers' and 'tabs' checkboxes disabled on archive upload). The displayed warnings on archive upload remain, pending further discussion.
  * Adding GSON dependency.
  * Interacting with the GBIF Registry API using Java is painful since we don't really have a client designed specifically for this purpose. This commit adds a fo' reals GBIF Registry client with zero dependencies on IPT proper. It's probably be a candidate to move into the gbif-registry project:
  * Fixes Issue 236.
  * Persists contact metadata from eml.xml input into resource.contactName and resource.contactEmail and adds contact as a full-fledged Agent in Basic Metadata form. Contact is an Agent independent of creator and metadataProvider. It requires an unatomized name, which is now constructed from the contact.firstName plus space plus contact.lastName. Persistence to eml.xml tested and tests added to EMLFactoryTest.
  * Added for testing
  * Fixes issue 270 for the following vectors: ConfigAction now guards against a Base URL value that contains localhost, and RegistryManagerImpl now guards against registering a Base URL value that contains localhost.
  * Issue332 fix
  * Fixed the mvn eclipse:eclipse
  * Solves issue 296.
  * Title, description, language are now persisted from Eml to Resource in the basic metadata form. TODO: Resource contact and email.
  * Updating to reflect changes in how ingoreHeaderLines is handled.
  * This commit changes how the ignoreHeaderLines metafile property is handled. In particular, exactly ignoreHeaderLines number of lines are skipped for each archive file before reading actual data values. This commit also fixes CSV parsing which was incorrectly splitting on commas *within* double quotes.
  * Internationalisation of the alert when registering IPT instance, then comment it out to avoid the popup box.
  * Avoids null pointer exception if there is no organisation yet.
  * Addresses issue that private resources were visible on Home and Explore pages. Makes Home and Explore resource lists consistent with each other in appearance.
  * IPT now supports `ignoreHeaderLines` for values greater than 1, with the following assumptions:
  * Preliminary commit that supports generating eml.xml when a resource is published. Very slim unit testing coverage on this, so it requires review and further testing.
  * Preliminary commit that supports generating eml.xml when a resource is published. Very slim unit testing coverage on this, so it requires review and further testing.
  * This commit cleans up ArchiveUtil. It moves methods common to both state machines into shared scope.
  * A few inane fixes to Checklist Resource summary page.
  * This commit is a rollback of the r1953 change in how prepare() handled deserializing eml. The change caused eml wipes. +1 John for catching and debugging.
  * Fixes issue that resourceCreator country was being doubled with every added AssociatedParty, thus not showing country for Resource Creator in Basic Metadata screen thereafter.
  * Altered to accept checklist type resources as core resource types
  * Re-implements clean resource deletion from Basic Metadata form.
  * Fixes issue "Bean has no property named projectAbstract" when loading resources/dwc-archives/archive-occ.zip. EmlFactoryTests all pass.
  * Fixes issue that resource description did not persist between saves on metadata pages.
  * Adding support for Checklist (in addition to Occurrence) resources. Surfacing messages from archive import process to UI (including errors, warnings, and info). Taxonomy browsing for imported archive broken, but is fixed for single file uploads. Support for uploading single eml.xml file on basic metadata form.
  * Avoids Null Pointer Exception when null property encountered. Unclear why view.getExtension().getProperties() might sometimes has nulls in the list. Doesn't happen on first occurrence upload.
  * Fixes issue that resource creator home page did not persist correctly to eml output.
  * Addresses problem with metadata.termporalCoverageExample [sic] in Issue 319.
  * Addresses Issue 320, Physical Data form no loading.
  * Fixed error using non-existent eml.citations property. Final fix for Issue 321. Other missing properties brought up in that issue were committed in revision 1926.
  * Preliminary support for the following use cases, including Eml metadata support, fixed taxonomy browsing, fixed source id tracking, and support for CSV or Tab with or without headers:
  * EML metadata is not yet integrated, but this commit provides preliminary support and fixes for:
  * This commit adds initial support for archives (without extensions) that can be uploaded, imported, downloaded, and then re-imported.
  * Preliminary support for uploading a single source file with or without a header.
  * This commit supports uploading, auto/manual mapping, and importing core-only archives with any fieldsTerminatedBy value. Additionally, single file upload support is now functional for CSV files (not tab files yet).
  * Final tweaks to how the IPT handles non-tab separators in files.
  * This commit modifies how IPT reads data files. Before it assumed tab separation in files. Now, SourceFile persists its separator character which is now used by TabFileReader when splitting lines. The IPT now imports an uploaded archive and correctly outputs an archive for the base case archive type.
  * Before: SourceBase didn't persist its header which prevented auto-mapping in the PropertyMappingAction and ArchiveUtil was in /test instead of /src.
  * Preliminary commit without documentation and cleanup that introduces a state machine for processing archives.
  * SourceFile previews for single files and archives now functional in sources step. Able to upload archive (/gzip/archive-dwc.tar.gz), preview sources, map, import, and download archive.
  * Rolls back changes to SourceFile and patches a bug where NPE was thrown by BBox constructor during the import step.
  * This commit adds additional error checking, bug fixes, and unit testing coverage to the Dwc-Archive import system.
  * This commit fixes a bug that prevented auto-mapping of extension properties in the UI. Basically PropertyMappings are now created properly from ArchiveFile. Another fix is making sure that archives are expanded into the same directory that AppConfig expects to find them. H2 database is updated with latest extensions and vocabularies from GBIF.
  * Introducing a ResourceArchive.Type enumeration. Useful to know the type to guard against users creating one type of resource but attempting to bind it to another type.
  * This commit removes the need for a BaseManager without transaction support. Refactoring ArchiveAdapter with non-static references to injected managers resolved Spring transaction exceptions.
  * This commit adds a new method to ExtensionPropertyManager and its implementation for getting a property from an extension and qualified property name.
  * This commit adds initial prototype support for uploading an archive. To try it, create a new occurrence resource, and at the top of the form, select and upload an archive.
  * This commit refactors a couple of method names.
  * Fixes bug found in testing where metadata for resource under Manage/Resources was lost. Resource display was missing the resource id.
  * This commit contains initial implementations for ResourceArchiveService.createResource() and ResourceArchiveService.openArchive(), along with initial unit test coverage. There are unrelated changes in this commit due to minor style changes and added documentation.
  * Amended EmlFactoryTest to pass tests, fixing calls to spurious methods and removing the stubs to those methods. smaple.xml restored to original format. Recommended to not alter that file, or save it with Formatting Rules enforced. Saving that file with format rules in place will alter the structure (splitting long lines) and cause some tests to fail.
  * This commit introduces a few new classes and interfaces (with initial unit testing coverage) for handling archives in a more flexible way. Note: EmlFactory still fails in a couple of places. I added stub methods to Eml and TaxonomicCoverage with TODO annotations.
  * Removed unnecessary entity annotations from ResourceDisplay.
  * Fixed problem with getters not found in resourceManagerList.ftl. Redefined simpler publishing status now displayed in Manage/Resources table. Not fully tested. Will do that as long as connectivity allows.    Thanks to Aaron for sanity check.
  * This commit is a nearly complete attempt to display publishing status in Manage/Resources resource list table as in the Metadata Forms resource publication status box. Everything is in place to use private static class ResourceForDisplay to render status as internationalised private/unpublished changes/published. Note that PublicationStatus enum can't be changed without drastic refactoring even into H2. The resourceManagerList.ftl shows how the MetadataAction.resouresForDisplay list is meant to be used, but is is not currently functional due to exceptions trying to invoke getters for the ResourceDisplay properties. I have run out of time trying to figure out why the getters aren't being seen. To recover previous functionality for this resourceManagerList table, only lines 4 and 7 in resourceManagerList.ftl have to be reverted to the previous revision.
  * Minor fixes to UI for Publishing Status box on Metadata Forms.
  * This commit deletes DataArchiveManagerImplTest which has been replaced by DataArchiveManagerTest in r1924.
  * This commit adds a complete DataArchiveManager implementation along with initial unit test coverage.
  * This commit replaces google-collections with google-guava, adds commons-io and commons-compress for Darwin Core Archive support, and adds javax.jws for compiling with Java 1.5 instead of 1.6.
  * This commit enables DataArchiveManagerImpl to open all supported Darwin Core Archive types, including archives that are compressed using ZIP and GZIP. The implementation is based on the 1.1 dwc-archive-reader library that is deployed to the GBIF Maven repository. This commit also adds unit testing coverage and example archives.
  * Removed Java5 dependency on string.empty() Changed version of DwC-A reader to the publicly available stable version
  * First pass at making the publishing status more transparent in the Metadata Entry pages.
  * Removed Java6 dependencies
  * Update to clean up resource.ftl, which was causing an exception after the EML metadata was refactored completely. This page will need further work to be complete.
  * 
  * Added dependency for dwc-archive-reader and cleaned up some general formatting.
  * Extending the DataArchiveManager service interface with support for opening data archives in the Darwin Core Archive format. Note: This commit depends on a local build of dwc-archive-reader r997.
  * Eradicating remaining bugs keeping Basic Metadata from from publishing. All metadata forms now do, though there remains an exception if the IPT instance hasn't been registered.
  * Bug fix: Admin users can now (1) register the IPT with the GBIF Registry as an organization and save changes to it, (2) register the IPT as a resource with the GBIF Registry and save changes to it.
  * Major update to persist eml.xml files.
  * Changed dev registry URL
  * fixed
  * self closed anchors might cause trouble in some html browsers and its recommended to explicitly close them
  * what is this file needed for at all ???
  * Fixing potential NPE when database gets corrupted and no core extension is existing. See http://code.google.com/p/gbif-providertoolkit/issues/detail?id=192
  * Adding back getters for CV stuff.
  * Geographic coverage form now persists data to eml.xml when published. Note: This commit is for supporting a single coverage (not multiple yet, pending Maps refactor to JS API).
  * Removed duplicate getter methods.
  * Fixed a minor syntax error.
  * Updated Methods form to allow choice of Step Method, Sampling, or Quality Control, each of which can be added as many times as desired.
  * Collections page updated to allow a choice of count range or count with uncertainty. Added property rangeMean in JGTICuratorialUnit to accomplish this.
  * Changes to make default date format yyyy-mm-dd and bug fixes in temporal coverages when setting startDate greater than endDate.
  * TemporalCoverages form now functioning correctly with choice of single date, date range, formation period, or living time period - as many of each as desired.
  * Flushed out a template in the reselect function that takes action based on the type selected.
  * Fixed the change handler callback for the type select input. Added some example code that disables textboxes.
  * Non-functional commit.
  * Resource GeoCovereage is now the min min and max max of all coverages associated with the EML.
  * LivingTimePeriod and FormationPeriod have been added to the temporalCoverage Form with a select form element for each coverage to choose which type of coverage it will be, with the idea of hiding all but the relevant one(s). The only thing that hasn't been done is turning the elements on and off based on the coverage type selection.
  * Server side publishing functional, though need to resolve correct behavoir for persisting multiple GeospatialCoverages with a Resource. AJAX call from UI still an issue.
  * Fully functional Taxonomic Coverages form.
  * Fixed a couple of FTL syntax errors.
  * Resolved metadata form transition problems. Refactored rights.ftl to additionalMetadata.ftl for consistency.
  * Fully functional and tested Keyword Set page.
  * First attempt atkeywords page. Keyword panel doesn't open with KeywordSet widget when clickin on Add new Keyword Set.
  * When new eml is created in prepare method, it's resource is now set.
  * Copying properties to eml now happens after eml is guaranteed to be not null.
  * Some properties in resource are the same as what's required in eml, so this commit copies these properties from resource to eml in the prepare method.
  * Adds new property: alternateIdentifier
  * Solved critical issue keeping new resource from being created. New resource id was not being propagated to the resource inside the Eml object and form element had the wrong key.
  * Rolling back form name change.
  * This commit addresses item 22 from John's list. Adds next and nextPage properties to MetadataAction to fix errors when saving. The basic metadata form (metadata.ftl) now redirects to the organisation form (organisation.ftl) after saving via a modification to struts.xml configuration.
  * Functional Collection Metadata page with multiple CuratorialUnits.
  * Fully functional PhysicalData Form.
  * Bug fix: Agent country selection now saves.
  * Minor fixes based on testing.
  * Setting up for multiple coverages.
  * Temporal Coverages, tested.
  * Poorly resolved conflict in citations.ftl resulted in the loss of this code.
  * Improved consistency and flow between forms and updated form element properties for internationalization.
  * UI modifications to support citations form.
  * Modifications to support citations form.
  * Adding citation widgets.
  * Bug fixes to dto and widgets JS. Modified submenu JSP to include citations link.
  * Bug fix: Methods form now submitting and saving. Also adding citations form.
  * Bug fix: EmlEditorAction was not saving existing EML properties when form submitted with values.
  * Bug fix: Creator and MetadataProvider country selections now save.
  * Bug fix: Resource language select box value now saves.
  * Moved the EML GBIF profile schema to the metadata project managed by Eamonn and Paul at http://gbif-metadataeditor.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Docs/eml-gbif-profile.xsd
  * Must sleep. Forms Research Project, Sampling Method, Temporal Coverage, Basic Metadata, Organisation, Associated Parties are all saving. Sampling Method opens with a blank Method and doesn't persist this or added Methods. Basic Metadata doesn't persist language and both Creator and Metadata Provider Countries have missing label and don't persist. Temporal Coverage save known to clear out the Eml, may be true of Research Project and Sampling Method Form saves as well. Taxonomic Coverage, Geographic Coverage, IP Rights, and Additional Metadata Forms yet to be addressed.
  * Functional temporal coverages form.
  * One step closer. samplingMethod method being invoked server side. temporalCovereages method still isn't.
  * Similarly broken methods.ftl. Committed for consultation with Aaron.
  * Broken tempcoverage.ftl. Committed for consultation with Aaron.
  * Simpler refactor for bibliographic citations that maintains ease of implementation in the digester.
  * Eml is now modeling citations using a single String citation property and a List<String> citations property. It no longer depends on BibliographicCitationSet. The citation unit tests in EmlFactoryTest.java need to be reviewed.
  * Cleanup after testing Basic Metadata, Resource Organisation, and AssociatedParties metadata forms. Omitted extraneous Creator form.
  * Modified to project form fields for creator, metadataProvider, pubDate, abstract, and title.
  * Moved the Model objects residing in src/test to src/main Added rules to the EmlFactory to make the test happy
  * Further changes to EML processing based on resolution of issues about JGTICuratorialUnit and StudyAreaDescription. Title in multiple languages not yet attempted. In this revision there is an unresolved test failure in EmlFactoryTest.java:144. The name attribute of the <studyAreaDescription><descriptor name="generic" citableClassificationSystem="false"> is not being read in the EmlFactory, whereas the citableClassificationSystem attribute is. Need to figure out why.
  * updated sample to match schema changes
  * added descriptor name enumeration and the jgtiUnitType element
  * use correct schema for validation
  * added first draft for a gbif eml profile xml schema
  * First pass edit of eml.ftl to build the full eml file. There are outstanding issues that need clarification, and this is untested - just don't want to lose it and may want to refer to it in consultations.
  * Fixed save state.
  * Removed organisation selection from the form.
  * Adding metadata support for associating an organisation with a resource.
  * Bug fix: AgentPanel now correctly renumbers name attribute indexes when an agent is removed from the DOM.
  * Removed crud.
  * Several fixes to AssociatedParties UI and associated server code. This revision contains a bug in widget.js _resize whereby the address properties of a removed AssociatedParty are not moved with the rest of the Agent.
  * Changes to make the Organisation selection, editing and saving to the registry function, and consistently, between Admin and Manage Organisation Forms.
  * New Organisation to replace old Organization, which was causing difficult to recognize inconsistencies in ftls. Includes Aaron's most recent changes to Organization class.
  * This commit adds all EML agent properties to the Associated Parties form.
  * Added nodeName property.
  * This commit adds a new manager submenu to the UI called 'Associated Parties' which allows managers to dynamically create, edit, and delete agents associated with the resource EML. Agents form values are created, populated, and injected by Struts into the Eml.associatedParties property. The EmlEditorAction persists and reads these values via XML.
  * Bug fix: getIptOrganization() now returns the IPT instance organization with the password and organization key.
  * Added logoURL, distributionUrl, and bibliographicCitations to Eml, with tests that pass using sample.xml
  * added link to the dwc archive. Needs testing when publishing of resources is working in trunk again
  * Adding support for display and editing of dynamic associated party UI elements. This version is still a bit buggy.
  * Server side changes to support new metadata UI.
  * Code style changes only. No functional diff.
  * Bug fix: When loading an Eml object for a resource, if the Eml file doesn't exist yet, it creates a new Eml file and serializes it to file using XStream.
  * Code style changes only. No functional diff.
  * Code style changes only. No functional diff.
  * Now builds the HTML map using the enumeration name() value instead of the name property value. Required to correctly support i8ln.
  * Code style changes only. No functional diff.
  * Code style changes only. No functional diff.
  * Added for test
  * Bug fix in fromString() method.
  * Documented toRole and trimmed the argument.
  * Added static method support for creating a Role from a string.
  * Address now overrides equals and hashCode.
  * Agent now overrides equals, hashCode, and toString. The setRole(String) method modified to dispatch to Role static method.
  * The save() method now saves the Eml object.
  * MetadataAction now loads the Eml object and makes it available to Freemarker. This is required since the basic metadata form now includes EML specific properties.
  * Changes from branches/ipt-1.1-metadata into trunk.
  * Adds UI support for the Taxonomic Coverages category of the GBIF Extended Metadata Profile (see definition of elements document: http://goo.gl/Cjan). Note that the form submission code has not yet been updated to receive the new values on the server side. This will be committed separately.
  * Adds UI support for the Methods category of the GBIF Extended Metadata Profile (see definition of elements document: http://goo.gl/Cjan). Note that the form submission code has not yet been updated to receive the new values on the server side. This will be committed separately.
  * Update to include merged Darwin Core changes from ipt-1.1-DwC branch.
  * Added keywords back to the temporal coverage page. Expected input is now comma separated Thesaurus:Keyword pairs (instead of just keywords), such as Animal:Bird, Insect:Spider, etc.
  * Removed keywords from the temporal coverage page.
  * Adds UI support for the General category of the GBIF Extended Metadata Profile (see definition of elements document: http://goo.gl/Cjan). Note that the form submission code has not yet been updated to receive the new values on the server side. This will be committed separately.
  * updated gbif maven repo
  * Fixes a minor layout bug related to the 'resend password' link.
  * Fixes a corner case in the RegistryManagerImpl.isOrganizationRegistered method.
  * Removes JavaScript debugging alert().
  * Adds i8ln property support for the manager UI that supports creating organizations. Fixes a corner case int RegistryManagerImpl.isOrganizationRegistered method.
  * This commit is related to issue 252 (supporting different organizations for each resource). Adds UI support for a manager menu with options for selecting resource and organization submenus.
  * Removed the depracated applicationContext-IPTfullOnly.xml <context-param>.
  * This commit updates method names to be consistent with modifications to the RegistryManager interface.
  * This commit is related to issue 252 (supporting different organizations for each resource). Adds three new columns to the resource table for modeling organization title, password, and uuid.
  * This commit is related to issue 252 (supporting different organizations for each resource). RegistryManager and RegistryManagerImpl have been modified to handle the new Organization objects (with unit testing in RegistryManagerImplTest). The manager UI now supports an organization option in the manager menu that presents a form for registering new organizations with the GBIF Registry. This UI is supported on the client side by createOrg.ftl (mostly copied from configOrg.tpl) and on the server side by CreateOrgAction.
  * This commit updates the context configuration of unit tests for applicationContext-filtered.xml and applicationContext.xml.
  * simplified config files and merged then into 2+1 as IPT lite via war overlay is not needed anymore
  * This commit is related to issue 252 (supporting different organizations for each resource). The new Organization class models a GBIF Registry organization. A new RegistryManager implementation will soon be added that accesses organization data from this new class instead of from AppConfig which contains organization information from the IPT instance.
  * 
  * This commit is related to issue 252 (supporting different organizations for each resource). Basically it allows users to associate an existing organization with any existing or new resource via the basic metadata form. Resource specific organization title, uuid, and password are modeled in Resource and are consequently persisted to H2. Open questions: How to synchronize resource specific organization data with the registry? Should the IPT perform this step during the publishing process? Also, how to integrate organization creation for managers? This functionality currently exists for admins. Should the basic metadata form support a UI for creating new organizations within the basic metadata form or should it be a separate form (similar to the separate admin configOrg.tpl UI)?
  * Modified KeywordSet my updating documentation and renaming internal variables to be more clear.
  * Adding the KeywordSet class that supports associating multiple keywords with a single thesaurus. In turn this supports generating the following EML: <keywordSet>   <keywordThesaurus>Zoology Vocabulary Version 1     <keyword>Insect</keyword>   	<keyword>Fly</keyword>     <keyword>Bee</keyword>   </keywordThesaurus>   <keywordThesaurus>Zoology Vocabulary Version 2     <keywordSet>     <keyword>Spider</keyword>   </keywordThesaurus> </keywordSet>
  * Modified the Eml class to support the GBIF Extended Metadata Profile.
  * Refactored the Project class by having it override Object.equals and Object.hashCode.
  * Added the TemporalCoverage class for modeling temporal coverage attributes. Designed to support the GBIF Extended Metadata Profile. Also added the TemporalCoverageTest class for related unit testing.
  * Changed TaxonomicCoverage by making the keywords property and ImmutableSet<TaxonKeyword>.
  * The TaxonomicCoverage class now implements the java.io.Serializable interface and has a generated serial version UID. Also update documentation for the create method.
  * Added the TaxonomicCoverage class for modeling taxonomic coverage attributes. Designed to support the GBIF Extended Metadata Profile. Also added the TaxonomicCoverageTest class for related unit testing.
  * Refactored and renamed the GeoKeyword class to GeoSpatialCoverage. Designed to support the GBIF Extended Metadata Profile. Also added the GeoSpatialCoverageTest class for related unit testing.
  * Refactored the TaxonKeyword class by making it immutable and having it override Object.equals, Object.hashCode, and Object.toString methods. Designed to support the GBIF Extended Metadata Profile. Also added the TaxonKeywordTest class for related unit testing. Note: This refactor required changing how TaxonKeyword instances are created in the EmlEditorAction class, which was modified and included in this commit.
  * The Attribute class now implements the java.io.Serializable interface and has a generated serial version UID.
  * Added the Attribute class for modeling genertic attributes. Designed to support the GBIF Extended Metadata Profile. Also added the AttributeTest class for related unit testing.
  * The classes in this commit now implement the java.io.Serializable interface and have generated serial version UIDs.
  * Added new properties to the Project class (id and uuid) to support the GBIF Extended Metadata Profile.
  * Added the PhysicalData class for modeling physical data. Designed to support the GBIF Extended Metadata Profile. Also added the PhysicalDataTest class for related unit testing.
  * Moved the Charsets class from a LocaleBundle inner class to org.gbif.provider.model.eml.Charsets proper.
  * Added the Method class for modeling sampling methods. Designed to support the GBIF Extended Metadata Profile. Also added the MethodTest class for related unit testing.
  * Added the JgtiCuratorialUnit class for modeling JGTI curatorial units. Designed to support the GBIF Extended Metadata Profile. Also added the JgtiCuratorialUnitTest class for related unit testing.
  * Added the LocaleBundle class for modeling a Locale with a Charset encoding. Designed to support the GBIF Extended Metadata Profile. Also added the LocaleBundleTest class for related unit testing.
  * split the struts.xml into a struts-common.xml and the IPT full specific struts.xml, merged the applicationContext files into a shared applicationContext.xml, applicationContext-filtered.xml and a full IPT specific applicationContext-IPTfullOnly.xml
  * Fixes issue 260. Basically AppConfig has been modified to include a full text search hit count (defined in application.properties). FullTextSearchManagerLucene now uses this value (instead of a hard coded one) when setting the result hit count.
  * Fixes issue 235. Basically the buildPropertySelect method requires a prefix argument that qualifies each property name with a table alias. Before this change, the resulting SQL was invalid since select properties were not qualified. Consequently, ExtensionMapping objects were not added to the archiveFiles argument to the writeDescriptor method which resulted in incorrect meta.xml rendering.
  * No functional changes in this commit. Basically just swapped a getter invocation with a local variable for resource id.
  * Fixes issue 263. Modifies the load method to create a new Eml object and write it to XML when the resource is new or when an existing EML file cannot be read.
  * added the war overlay plugin to generate war and classes artifacts at the same build time. Needed for IPT lite war overlay
  * added dependency to IPT classes
  * overlay working, no changes so far. Its the regular IPT!
  * 
  * removed xfire and dwr relicts
  * The files in this commit were incorrectly importing the depracated Constants class from AppFuse. These imports now reference org.gbif.provider.util.Constants.
  * merged back branches/ipt-1.0RC3-appfuse into trunk. Branch ipt-1.0RC3-appfuse has removed lots of appfuse artifacts and refactored remaining pieces into the ipt packages while migrating to freemarker as much as possible.
  * update of french properties
  * General cleanup for 1.0 RC3. No functional changes.
  * Fixes a development artifact in provider_cfg.geoserver_data_dir by setting the value back to null.
  * Fixes an issue where a Javascript tokenization error occurs in submenu_actions_publish.jsp when i8ln values (such as publish.error) are injected into method calls (such as alert). The issue results in the publish button not rendering when managing a resource. The solution is removing all \n characters in i8ln properties files.
  * 
  * adapted SQL to new DarwinCore refactoring
  * Updated TEST_OCC_RESOURCE_ID from 11 to 13.
  * Formatting cleanup to DarwinCore. Added new baseline unit test that loads a test resource, saves each DarwinCore entity, then deletes it.
  * DarwinCore baseline unit tests.
  * Initial import of test resource that support new Darwin Core.
  * Initial import of database modifications that support new Darwin Core.
  * Removing old Darwin Core test resource.
  * Initial import of baseline unit testing for modifications that support new Darwin Core.
  * Initial import of modifications to support new Darwin Core.
  * Un-commented the testResources block in pom.xml which copies all resources (including data directory to target/test-classes/test-webapp/data). After that, running unit tests within Eclipse works since AppConfig can find the data directory.
  * Fix for issue 242.
  * 
  * 
  * More updates due to standard Darwin Core, this time to ftls. More to come.
  * Removed lob.db file as it no longer applies to the contents of the ipt.data.db. It probably contained text for the Pontaurus resource.
  * Database update to standard Darwin Core published 9 Oct 2009. Contains data for tables ROLE, THESAURUS_VOCABULARY, THESAURUS_CONCEPT, THESAURUS_TERM, EXTENSION, EXTENSION_PROPERTY, APP_USER, and USER_ROLE. Other tables were left empty, as these contain resource-specific data.
  * Changes to enable the standard Darwin Core published 9 Oct 2009. Changes to tests were only to suppress errors. Database changes to be committed separately.
  * Enabled French in interface.
  * Removed spurious character that killed Spanish translations.
  * Set PROVIDER_CFG.IPT_META_DESCRIPTION to the empty string.
  * Reversing spurious change to user.logout.
  * update of french properties
  * Minor bug fix in index.tpl that adds an <img> tag to the DOM only if the image URL is valid. Updated the wiki link in configIpt.tpl to a new wiki page that describes how to complete the IPT installation. Updated configOrg.tpl with new properties that describe how to reset the password and also moved the reset password link to the top of the form (addresses GBIF registry interaction for release 1).
  * Two more properties for header.jsp.
  * Commented out unused property.
  * Spanish properties with a partial update.
  * Remove spurious test characters.
  * Removed duplicate link to es internationalization.
  * Refactored how the main page is rendered prior to customizing/configuring the IPT instance. Internationalization is now supported. Added link to online manual in admin section with details for customizing/configuring IPT.
  * Default properties file updated with internationalization changes in ftl and jsp files.
  * Changed the resource_id property name to resourceId in BaseResourceAction. Consequently had to rename all references from resource_id to resourceId across all resources.
  * Reverting back to r1619
  * Changed the resource_id property name to resourceId in BaseResourceAction. Consequently had to rename all references from resource_id to resourceId across all resources.
  * Schema updates to Standard Darwin Core.
  * Update to Standard Darwin Core from February draft version.
  * moved to ECAT dev site
  * 
  * Added ABCD as potential TAPIR output model - lacks concrete implementation
  * Allow several extensions with the same name but different namespace to coexist.
  * renamed extension tables to include namespace hash
  * forgot to remove the sf.menu listener and taglib
  * removed menu plugin and coded menu as simple menu.jsp accessing authorised roles via session
  * use struts tags
  * Changed the build default goal from jetty:run to jetty:run-war.
