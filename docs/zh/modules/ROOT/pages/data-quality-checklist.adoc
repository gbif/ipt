Use this checklist to help review biodiversity datasets. Note it is particularly suited for checking occurrence and sampling event datasets.

The checklist will help ensure that the data is complete, meaning it contains valid answers to the five Ws:

* <<What event happened?>>
* <<Who acted in the event?>>
* <<When did the event take place?>>
* <<Where did the event take place?>>
* <<Why did the event happen?>>

Examples of events include a species observation, a physical specimen being collected, or a biological sampling event.

Additionally, the checklist ensures that the <<Dataset Metadata>> also contains answers to the five Ws in order to facilitate reuse of the data.

== Instructions

If the dataset has been registered with GBIF, give yourself a running start by reviewing the dataset's 'Stats' page. Here you can find the set of issues that GBIF discovered while interpreting the dataset:

image::ipt2/InterpretationIssues2.png[]

Next, read the dataset metadata to get a better understanding about the data.

Next, load the data into https://openrefine.org/[OpenRefine]. This will allow https://docs.openrefine.org/manual/facets[faceted browsing] to get the big picture of the data.

There are various ways each of the five Ws can be answered. Each 'check' relates to one or more Darwin Core fields. Therefore try to perform as many checks as possible based on the Darwin Core fields present in the dataset.

Compile a list of all checks that fail and report them back to the data publisher, referring to each check by its 'Check-ID'. This will make providing feedback a less time consuming and verbose process.

== Quality checks

=== What event happened?

==== What type of event was it?

|===
| Check-ID | Fields | Requirements

| *what 1* | `occurrenceID`, `basisOfRecord`, `eventID`  | The species observation event uniquely identified by `occurrenceID` and having `basisOfRecord` equal to `HumanObservation` or `MachineObservation` indicating whether the observation was performed by a machine or by one or more people. If this observation was derived from a sampling event, it must have the `eventID` of the sampling event filled in.
| *what 2* | `occurrenceID`, `basisOfRecord`, `catalogNumber`, `collectionCode`, `eventID`  | The specimen preservation event uniquely identified by `occurrenceID` and having `basisOfRecord` equal to `PreservedSpecimen`, `FossilSpecimen` or `LivingSpecimen` indicating its specific type. Ideally a specimen is deposited in a collection and therefore can be assigned both a `catalogNumber` and `collectionCode`.  If this specimen was derived from a sampling event, it must have the `eventID` of the sampling event filled in.
| *what 3* | `occurrenceID`, `basisOfRecord`, `materialSampleID`, `catalogNumber`, `collectionCode`, `eventID`  | The physical result of a sampling event uniquely identified by both `occurrenceID` and having `basisOfRecord` equal to `MaterialSample`. If the sample was preserved (vs destructively processed) as a specimen and deposited in a collection it will ideally be assigned both a `catalogNumber` and `collectionCode`. The `eventID` of the sampling event must be filled in.
| *what 4* | `eventID`, `fieldNumber`, `parentEventID`   | The actual sampling event uniquely identified by `eventID`. The `eventID` should be a GUID, otherwise it should reuse the `fieldNumber`. The `parentEventID` indicates the event is a sub-sampling event. To be valid, all `parentEventIDs` must reference `eventIDs` of records defined in the same dataset. Otherwise, the `parentEventID` must be a globally unique identifier (e.g. DOI, HTTP, URI, etc) that resolves to an event record described elsewhere. Ideally all sub-sampling events share the same data and location as the parent event.
|===

==== If it was a species occurrence related event - how many species were there?

|===
| Check-ID | Fields | Requirements

| *what 5* | `individualCount`, `organismQuantity`, `organismQuantityType`, `occurrenceStatus` | The species abundance must be filled in using `individualCount` and the pair `organismQuantity` & `organismQuantityType`. For relative abundance use the pair `organismQuantity` & `organismQuantityType` with values for `organismQuantityType` coming from the {latest-quantity-type}[GBIF Quantity Type Vocabulary]. Zero abundance (absence of the species) must be coupled with `occurrenceStatus` set to "absence" per the {latest-occurrence-status}[GBIF Occurrence Status Vocabulary].
|===

==== If it was a species occurrence related event - what species was it?

|===
| Check-ID | Fields | Requirements

| *what 6* | `scientificName`, `taxonRank`, `kingdom`, `phylum`, `class`, `order`, `family`, `genus`, `subgenus` | The full scientific name with authorship and date information if known must be entered in `scientificName`. To prevent ambiguity, the `taxonRank` of the scientific name should be supplied as per the {latest-rank}[GBIF Taxonomic Rank Vocabulary]. Also to prevent ambiguity, as much higher taxonomy as possible should be filled in: `kingdom`, `phylum`, `class`, `order`, `family`, `genus`.
| *what 7* | `taxonID`, `nameAccordingTo`, `nameAccordingToID` | The identifier for the Taxon assigned to the subject. If the Taxon is defined according to a well known source, it is recommended filling in `nameAccordingTo` with the name of the source and `nameAccordingToID` with the identifier for the Taxon assigned as per the source (same as `taxonID`).

=== Who acted in the event?

|===
| Check-ID | Fields | Requirements

| *who 1* | `recordedBy` | The full names of each person acting in the event (e.g. collecting, observing, etc) should be entered in `recordedBy` using the vertical bar as a separator. Note there is a separate field for capturing the person(s) making the identification (see below).
| *who 2* | `institutionCode`, `ownerInstitutionCode` | A name or acronym of the institution acting in the event may be entered in `institutionCode` and `ownerInstitutionCode`. These can be different hence `institutionCode` can have physical custody of a specimen and `ownerInstitutionCode` can have legal ownership of the specimen.

| *when 4* | `eventTime`, `year`, `month`, `day`, `startDayOfYear`, `endDayOfYear` | Although it appears redundant, it is recommended trying to fill in `eventTime`, `year`, `month`, `day`, `startDayOfYear` and `endDayOfYear` for date ranges as completely as possible. If there is a date range spanning days, `day` is left blank. If there is a date range spanning months, `month` is left blank. If there is a date range spanning years, `year` is left blank. If the start date resolution is specific to the day fill in `startDayOfYear`. If the end date resolution is specific to the day fill in `endDayOfYear`.

== Dataset Metadata

The dataset metadata should contain enough information to facilitate reuse of the data while preventing misinterpretation. Publishers should also provide evidence of the rigour that went into producing the data while acknowledging its various contributors and funders. Ultimately this may lead to new sources of collaboration and funding.

|===
