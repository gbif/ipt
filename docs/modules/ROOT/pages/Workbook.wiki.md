Originally designed as a companion for data publishing courses, the IPT Workbook puts together a comprehensive set of practice problems for installing, configuring, and using the IPT to publish biodiversity datasets. 

If you can solve the entire workbook, you can consider yourself an IPT expert. The problems vary in their level of difficulty, but no matter how hard the problem is, helpful hints are provided to help guide you successfully through them. 

So what are you waiting for? [Download the workbook](https://github.com/gbif/ipt/wiki/gbif-ipt-docs/downloads/IPT%20Workbook%20-%206%20Feb%202013.pdf), and the accompanying [sample datasets folder](https://github.com/gbif/ipt/wiki/gbif-ipt-docs/downloads/sample%20datasets.zip), and test yourself!
