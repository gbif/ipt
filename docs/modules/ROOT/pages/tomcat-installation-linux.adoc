= Install Tomcat on Linux

Tomcat is usually installed using distribution packages.

For example, on CentOS or RedHat systems, `yum install tomcat`.

Or on Debian or Ubuntu systems, `apt install tomcat8`.

You can set Tomcat to start up automatically with `systemctl enable tomcat` or similar.

Most Linux users seem not to need any additional advice; if you do please ask on the xref:140-resources.adoc#_ipt_mailing_list[mailing list].
