The IPT user interface and user manual both need internationalisation. Internationalisation is a community effort, and everyone is welcome to join.

== How To Translate the User Interface
The preferred way of translating the user interface is using an online translation tool called https://crowdin.com/project/gbif-ipt[Crowdin]. To join, just login to https://crowdin.com/project/gbif-ipt[Crowdin], select the language you would like to translate, and hit the 'Join' button. A manager will handle your request, and add you to the translation team. After that, you can get started translating. Most people find Crowdin incredibly easy and intuitive to use. For help using Crowdin, you can always refer to their https://support.crowdin.com/for-translators/getting-started-translators/interface-overview[Knowledge Base].
