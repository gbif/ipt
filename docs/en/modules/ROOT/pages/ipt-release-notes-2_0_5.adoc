WARNING: It is always a good idea to take the precaution of backing up the existing IPT data directory before performing an upgrade.

An upgrade can be performed in 3 steps:

. Replace the previous .war file with the latest edition
. Backup the existing data directory
. Reuse the existing data directory during setup

If upgrading from 2.0.3, once the upgrade is complete, resource managers should:

. Reset the resource subtype (if applicable), making the selection on the basic metadata page. The reason being that this list now refers to a controlled vocabulary in IPT 2.0.4/5 and previous selections will have been reset.
. Re-save the metadata for each resource. The reason being that additional validation has been added to the metadata pages in IPT 2.0.4/5 in order to ensure better compliance with the GBIF metadata profile.
