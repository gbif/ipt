"Most user interface controls have both enabled and disabled modes. If the "
"control is enabled, it will either commit an action when clicked (a button, "
"for example), or it will allow changes to be made to the value bound to the "
"control (a text, check, or select box, for example). In the latter case the "
"changes will be saved, if possible, when the form on which they appear is "
"saved, which is generally accomplished on a given page by clicking on a "
"button labelled \"Save\". Disabled controls show the value of the associated "
"information, but do not allow that information to be saved under the "
"conditions in effect at the time they appear. The purpose for most user "
"interface controls is indicated by an associated label that appears above "
"and/or to the left of the control. Sometimes supplemental information is "
"also accessible from an associated information icon."
