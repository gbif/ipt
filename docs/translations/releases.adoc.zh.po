Additionally, please note that GBIF recently released a new set of Microsoft Excel templates for uploading data to the IPT. The new templates provide a simpler solution for capturing, formatting and uploading three types of GBIF data classes: xref:sampling-event-data.adoc[sampling-event data], xref:occurrence-data.adoc[occurrence data], and xref:checklist-data.adoc[checklist data]. More information about these templates can be found in https://www.gbif.org/newsroom/news/new-darwin-core-spreadsheet-templates[this news article]."
