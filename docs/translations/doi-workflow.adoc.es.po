After the mandatory metadata has been entered, the publisher may reserve a DOI. Since the existing DOI has been entered, however, the IPT reuses that instead of minting a new DOI. Of course the IPT's DOI-assigning account must have the rights to manage this DOI, otherwise an error message will appear."
