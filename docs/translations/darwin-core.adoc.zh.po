A fundamental principle of the Darwin Core as a library of terms is to keep the definition of terms distinct from the technology used to share them, e.g. XML or RDF."

msgid "Until the ratification of Darwin Core as a standard it was used to describe primary species occurrence data, in particular through DiGIR and XML encoding.  When we were looking for a very simple checklist data exchange format and with the rise of tagging of species on Flickr, it became apparent that simple terms for biodiversity in the tradition of Dublin Core would be very useful - and indeed very much overlapping with the Darwin Core terms in use already."

Some can be used to define a record (such as occurrenceID for an Occurrence record; taxonID for a Taxon record), while others (such as higherGeographyID) refer to an identifier for information stored outside the record.  For example `namePublishedInID` is used to refer to an identifier (perhaps a DOI or other resolvable identifier) for the publication in which a scientificName was originally established.  Note that `taxonID` used within an occurrence dataset would function as a pointer to a taxon defined somewhere else, such as in a checklist dataset, while `taxonID` within a Taxon record would act as the identifier for that record."
