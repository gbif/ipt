"The DwC-A format and the specific profile described here represent an "
"internationally recognized and ratified data exchange format for sharing "
"taxonomic data. All data exchange standards must strike a balance between "
"the technical scope and capacity on one hand, and social acceptance and "
"uptake on the other. Simple solutions sacrifice coverage and complexity in "
"favour of ease-of-use. Highly complex formats provide more complete "
"solutions for representing any type of data but at the expense of simplicity "
"and require supporting software and expertise. The Darwin Core Archive "
"format represents an intermediate position between the two ends of this "
"spectrum. It focuses on the key elements of taxonomic checklists and enables "
"an enriched set of data types to be linked to this core structure. The data "
"contained in an archive can be readily understood and used by many "
"biologists and data managers familiar with basic structured text files. By "
"providing an international standard that is relatively easy to produce and "
"consume, and that supports many of the key elements that compose a taxonomic "
"data resource, GBIF hopes to provide the creators and managers of checklists "
"with a standardized approach to sharing their data and promote common "
"approaches to the subsequent citation and recognition of their work. A "
"standard format also increases relevance and utility."
