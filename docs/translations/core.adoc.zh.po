Since IPT 2.1, there is the possibility to add custom cores to the IPT, which is useful for communities prototyping new data standards. In this way, their community can start trying to map their data to the new core, and iteratively refine its set of properties."

It is easiest to simply adapt an existing core definition, such as the {latest-dwc-occurrence}.xml[Darwin Core Occurrence Core]. Please note, the core definition must contain a property that serves as the record identifier (e.g. http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/occurrenceID for the Occurrence core, or http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/eventID for the Event Core. The process of creating a new non-core extension is exactly the same as for a core extension. The process of creating a new vocabulary (as a data type for a property within the core, or non-core extension) is different only in that the XML definition has to comply with the http://rs.gbif.org/schema/thesaurus.xsd[GBIF Thesaurus Schema]. Once again, it is easiest to adapt an existing vocabulary definition, such as the {latest-basis-of-record}[Darwin Core Type vocabulary]."

If it passes inspection, it will be merged in to https://rs.gbif.org/sandbox/core/, and included in the https://gbrdsdev.gbif.org/registry/extensions.json[Sandbox Registry's list of extensions]. When the core definition has been finalized, meaning that its set of properties has been frozen, it will be hosted at https://rs.gbif.org/core/ and included in the https://gbrds.gbif.org/registry/extensions.json[Live Registry's list of extensions] The same process applies to registering non-core extensions and vocabularies."

Multiple cores can be specified, delimiting them with the pipe `|` character. The first entry of ipt.core_idTerms is the ID for the first entry of core_rowTypes, and so on. Lastly, save the ipt.properties file, restart Tomcat, and then xref:administration.adoc#install-extension[install the core]. The core is now available to use in the IPT."
