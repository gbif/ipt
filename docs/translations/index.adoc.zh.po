msgid "The simplest way to begin using the IPT is to request a free account on a https://www.gbif.org/data-hosting-centres[trusted data hosting centre^] allowing you to manage your own datasets and publish them through GBIF.org without the hassle of setting up and maintaining the IPT on your own server."
msgstr "開始使用 IPT 最簡單的方法是在 https://www.gbif.org/zh-tw/data-hosting-centres [可信賴的數據託管中心^] 申請一個免費的帳戶。這樣一來，您就可以管理自己的數據集，並通過 GBIF.org 發佈，而無需自己另外設置和維護 IPT 伺服器。"
