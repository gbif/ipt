msgid "The DwC-A format and the specific profile described here represent an internationally recognized and ratified data exchange format for sharing taxonomic data. All data exchange standards must strike a balance between the technical scope and capacity on one hand, and social acceptance and uptake on the other. Simple solutions sacrifice coverage and complexity in favour of ease-of-use. Highly complex formats provide more complete solutions for representing any type of data but at the expense of simplicity and require supporting software and expertise. The Darwin Core Archive format represents an intermediate position between the two ends of this spectrum. It focuses on the key elements of taxonomic checklists and enables an enriched set of data types to be linked to this core structure. The data contained in an archive can be readily understood and used by many biologists and data managers familiar with basic structured text files. By providing an international standard that is relatively easy to produce and consume, and that supports many of the key elements that compose a taxonomic data resource, GBIF hopes to provide the creators and managers of checklists with a standardized approach to sharing their data and promote common approaches to the subsequent citation and recognition of their work. A standard format also increases relevance and utility."
