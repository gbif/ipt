It focuses on specific components of the Darwin Core Archive format, and some of the supporting extensions to the core event data class, and provides recommendations on how to best utilize these components to maximize the value of the shared data. This guide does not provide a detailed overview of the Darwin Core Archive format, instead please refer to the xref:darwin-core.adoc[Darwin Core Archives How-to Guide]."
msgstr ""

#.  By providing an international standard that is relatively easy to produce and consume, and that supports many of the key elements that compose a sampling-event data resource, GBIF hopes to provide the creators and managers of sampling-event data with a standardized approach to sharing their data and promote common approaches to the subsequent citation and recognition of their work. The specific degree of coverage depends very much on the individual resource.
#. type: Plain text
#: en/modules/ROOT/pages/best-practices-sampling-event-data.adoc:27
msgid "The DwC-A format and the specific profile described here represent an internationally recognized and ratified data exchange format for sharing sampling-event data. All data exchange standards must strike a balance between the technical scope and capacity on one hand, and social acceptance and uptake on the other. Simple solutions sacrifice coverage and complexity in favour of ease-of-use. Highly complex formats provide more complete solutions for representing any type of data but at the expense of simplicity and require supporting software and expertise. The Darwin Core Archive format represents an intermediate position between the two ends of this spectrum. It focuses on the key elements of sampling-event data and enables an enriched set of data types to be linked to this core structure. The data contained in an archive can be readily understood and used by many ecologists and data managers familiar with basic structured text files. With this international standard, GBIF hopes to facilitate sampling-event data sharing and promote common approaches to cite and recognize the work of the community creating and handling sampling-event data.  A standard format also increases relevance and utility."

Darwin Core Archives consist of a series of one or more text files, in standard comma- or tab-delimited format. The files are logically arranged in a star-like manner with one *core file*, listing the sampling events (sampling protocol, sample size, location, etc.) surrounded by a number of ‘*extensions*’, that describe related data types (such as species occurrences, measurements or facts related to the sampling event, etc). Links between core and extension records are made using an event identifier (*eventID*) data element. In this way, many extension records can exist for each single core event record. This “star-schema” provides a simple relational data model that supports many types of annotations that are common to sampling-event datasets."
