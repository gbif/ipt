"The default About page gives information about the current IPT installation, "
"including information about the hosting organization, if that has been "
"registered. This page is meant to be customized for the individual IPT "
"instance by editing the file called about.ftl in the directory called "
"\"config\" within the IPT data directory (see the information under the "
"\"IPT Settings\" heading in the \"Administration Menu\" section). The about."
"ftl file is a FreeMarker template that can contain a combination of HTML and "
"variable references of the form `${host.variable!\"alternate value if null\"}"
"`. After making changes to the about.ftl file, the About page will have to "
"be restarted to show the changes. Look at the default about.ftl file for "
"examples of variables that can be included."
