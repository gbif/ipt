"The first time the IPT is run, you will be presented with a few simple steps "
"to prepare the IPT for use. First it requires a location where the data for "
"the IPT installation can be stored. The format of the location entered on "
"the page must conform with the standard for an absolute path to a directory "
"on the operating system where the IPT is installed; relative paths are not "
"supported. For example, use a path such as `C:\\datadir` for Windows "
"environments or `/srv/datadir` for Unix and Mac OS X environments. The IPT "
"must have write permission to the selected location. If it does, the path "
"can be entered in the text box provided and then click on the button "
"labelled \"Save\" - the directory will be created if it doesn't already "
"exist. It is permissible to create the data directory first with the "
"appropriate write permissions, then enter the absolute path to the directory "
