"The first time the IPT is run, you will be presented with a few simple steps "
"to prepare the IPT for use. The IPT setup page (see screen image, below) is "
"the first of two setup pages. It requires publishers to confirm that they "
"have read and understand a disclaimer regarding data licensing. Next it "
"requires a location where the data for the IPT installation can be stored. "
"The format of the location entered on the page must conform with the "
"standard for an absolute path to a directory on the operating system where "
"the IPT is installed; relative paths are not supported. For example, use a "
"path such as `C:\\datadir` for Windows environments or `/srv/datadir` for "
"Unix and Mac OS X environments. The IPT must have write permission to the "
"selected location. If it does, the path can be entered in the text box "
"provided and then click on the button labelled \"Save\" - the directory will "
"be created if it doesn't already exist. It is permissible to create the data "
"directory first with the appropriate write permissions, then enter the "
