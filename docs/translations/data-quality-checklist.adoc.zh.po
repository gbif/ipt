If this observation was derived from a sampling event, it must have the `eventID` of the sampling event filled in.\n"

The `parentEventID` indicates the event is a sub-sampling event. To be valid, all `parentEventIDs` must reference `eventIDs` of records defined in the same dataset. Otherwise, the `parentEventID` must be a globally unique identifier (e.g. DOI, HTTP, URI, etc) that resolves to an event record described elsewhere.
