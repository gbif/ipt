Example: `SELECT * FROM specimen JOIN taxon ON taxon_fk = taxon.id`. While testing a large data source it is a good idea to include the appropriate language in the SELECT statement to limit the number of rows returned by the query - for example, in MySQL, `SELECT * FROM specimen JOIN taxon ON taxon_fk = taxon.id LIMIT 10`. When the statement has been fully tested with the Darwin Core Mappings (see the following section of the Quick Reference Guide), change the SQL Statement to return the full intended data set.\n"

msgid "Best practice is to assign a new DOI to the resource every time it undergoes a scientifically significant change. To enable the IPT to assign DOIs to resources, the IPT administrator must first configure an organization associated to the IPT with a DataCite account. Refer to the \"Configure Organizations\" section for help doing this. Otherwise the DOI buttons in the Published Versions sections are hidden from view. Once a DataCite account has been activated in the IPT, resource managers can reserve, delete, register, deactivate, and reactivate DOIs for their resources using this account. Each of these DOI operations is explained in detail below. For more help understanding how the IPT assigns DOIs to datasets, refer to the xref:doi-workflow.adoc[DOI Workflows] page in the IPT wiki."
