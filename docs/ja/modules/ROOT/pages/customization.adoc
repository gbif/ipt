= How to Style Your IPT

[WARNING]
====
Customization using `custom.css` does not work in version 2.5.0, see https://github.com/gbif/ipt/issues/1634[this issue].

Basic customizations can be made by editing `$tomcat/webapps/ipt/styles/main.css`.
====

IMPORTANT: Styling an IPT requires deployment using a servlet container like Tomcat. A deployment from Linux packages or Docker could only be styled by overriding the `custom.css` file in a forward proxy.

== Introduction

The following guide explains how to customize the IPT, and preserve your customization when upgrading your IPT's version.

In short, customization can be achieved by applying CSS overrides.

. Apply your desired CSS overrides in `custom.css` (choose a different colour scheme for example). You can find this file inside the deployed WAR folder, e.g. `$tomcat/webapps/ipt/styles`. The original https://github.com/gbif/ipt/blob/master/src/main/webapp/styles/custom.css[custom.css] comes pre-populated with a set of example CSS overrides to change the colours used in buttons, links, etc.
. Upon completion, backup the `custom.css` file somewhere safe so that it can be added once again after each IPT upgrade, which unfortunately will overwrite the `custom.css` file each time.

Take a look at the screenshot to see the effect of changing the default CSS.
