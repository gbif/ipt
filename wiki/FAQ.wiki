= Installation =

== After installing the IPT, I receive a message "FAIL - Application at context path /ipt could not be started" and the application does not launch. ==

Some Linux distributions, like [http://www.centos.org/ CentOS] or [http://www.redhat.com/ Red Hat Linux] include Tomcat incorrectly shipped with two libraries, xml-apis.jar and/or xalan.jar, in the Tomcat directories (../tomcat5/shared/, ../tomcat5/common/).
These libraries are not needed for the GBIF IPT operation so make a backup copy of them and then remove them. If that does not solve your problem, put the files back into place from the backup copy.

= Usage =
== Yikes when deleting a resource ==
Sometimes deleting a resource causes an error and leaves a corrupted resource behind that cannot be modified again and causes the resource listing in Explore and Manage to fail. Apart from a fresh reinstall the only way to fix this is to enable the H2 Console and modify the database manually like this, with `77` being the resource number to be deleted:

{{{
  DELETE RESOURCE WHERE ID=77;
}}}

= Performance =

== My GBIF IPT instance is slow. What can I do to improve performance? ==

Apache Tomcat comes with very little allocated memory. In order to increase performance, this amount should be increased depending on the amount of physical memory on the server. If the server has at least 2GB of RAM, the available memory should be increased to 1GB. For more information on how to do it, see the following links:

The following is known to run:
{{{export CATALINA_OPTS="-Xms512M -Xmx1024M -XX:PermSize=512M -XX:MaxPermSize=1024M"}}}
