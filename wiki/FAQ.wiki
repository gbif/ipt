In this page you will find answers for the most frequent asked questions about the GBIF IPT by installers and users. Please check the contents of this page before contacting the helpdesk.

= Installation =

== After installing the IPT, I receive a message "FAIL - Application at context path /ipt could not be started" and the application does not launch. ==

Some Linux distributions, like [http://www.centos.org/ CentOS] or [http://www.redhat.com/ Red Hat Linux] include Tomcat incorrectly shipped with two libraries, xml-apis.jar and/or xalan.jar, in the Tomcat directories (../tomcat5/shared/, ../tomcat5/common/).
These libraries are not needed for the GBIF IPT operation so make a backup copy of them and then remove them. If that does not solve your problem, put the files back into place from the backup copy.

= Usage =
== Yikes when deleting a resource ==
Sometimes deleting a resource causes an error and leaves a corrupted resource behind that cannot be modified again and causes the resource listing in Explore and Manage to fail. Apart from a fresh reinstall the only way to fix this is to enable the H2 Console and modify the database manually like this, with `77` being the resource number to be deleted:

{{{
  DELETE RESOURCE WHERE ID=77;
}}}

== DwC-A file doesn't include all records ==
=== Caused by invalid DATETIME value ===
If the published DwC-A file doesn't have records in the expected counts, and you see there is a message in Administration > Logs, which says

{{{
java.sql.SQLException: Cannot convert value '0000-00-00 00:00:00' from column 65 to TIMESTAMP
}}}

that means you have invalid date value in your data source, which, in this case, is "0000-00-00 00:00:00."

To solve this, you can update the value with "Null" value, and repeat the mapping steps.
Usually, you can rely on the log message to identify the column of interest, like in the example above, it says "column 65," which is the 65th column in the data source.

If your resource was imported to a SQL database, it's good to check if the default value for the DATETIME is set to 0 (zero).

= Performance =

== My GBIF IPT instance is slow. What can I do to improve performance? ==

Apache Tomcat comes with very little allocated memory. In order to increase performance, this amount should be increased depending on the amount of physical memory on the server. If the server has at least 2GB of RAM, the available memory should be increased to 1GB. For more information on how to do it, see the following links:
  * [http://explanatorygap.net/2005/03/06/configuring-tomcat-under-os-x-server-for-more-memory/]
  * http://wiki.apache.org/tomcat/FAQ/Memory

The following is known to run:
{{{export CATALINA_OPTS="-Xms512M -Xmx1024M -XX:PermSize=512M -XX:MaxPermSize=1024M"}}}

= Features =
== TAPIR support in IPT ==
The [http://www.tdwg.org/activities/tapir/specification/ TDGW Access Protocol for Information Retrieval (TAPIR) specification] by TDWG is an advanced XML based querying mechanism for datasources.

*For IPT 2.0, TAPIR support is removed.*

The IPT 1.0RC3 supports [http://www.tdwg.org/dav/subgroups/tapir/1.0/docs/TAPIRNetworkBuildersGuide_2008-09-18.html#toc19 TAPIR intermediate], i.e. it has a fixed [http://gbif-providertoolkit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/gbif-providertool/resources/tapir_dwc_model.xml darwin core output model] but does understand [http://www.tdwg.org/dav/subgroups/tapir/1.0/docs/tdwg_tapir_specification_2009-09-08.htm#toc65 KVP encoded] custom [http://www.tdwg.org/dav/subgroups/tapir/1.0/docs/tdwg_tapir_specification_2009-09-08.htm#toc47 filters]. It uses [http://www.tdwg.org/dav/subgroups/tapir/1.0/docs/tdwg_tapir_specification_2009-09-08.htm#toc57 URL encoded KVP requests] and does not support XML request documents.
