= How To Apply a License To a Dataset =

== Introduction ==

In accordance with the [http://www.gbif.org/terms/licences GBIF licensing policy], a dataset should be made available for use under CC0, CC-BY, or CC-BY-NC. This page describes how to properly apply a license to a dataset, ensuring consistency at the dataset level and the record level. 

Please note that CC0 is technically a waiver.

== Dataset Level ==

The license chosen must apply to the dataset as a whole. Only one license should be applied at the *dataset level*, even if multiple licenses are complimentary to each other (e.g. CC-BY and ODC-By).

To apply a license at the *dataset level* in the IPT, choose a license from the drop down on the basic metadata page:

In case different licenses apply to separate components of a dataset, the recommended best practice is to publish each component separately having their own metadata and identifier (e.g. DOI). This recommendation is in compliance with DataCite's recommended practice for such cases. 

== Record Level ==

All licenses specified at the *record level* should comply with the license at the dataset level.

To apply a license at the *record level* using the IPT, publishers should use/map to the Darwin Core term [http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/index.htm#dcterms:license license]. As per Darwin Core's recommendation, the URI of the license should be used to populate the license. Be careful not to add contradictory usage restrictions in the Darwin Core term [http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/index.htm#dcterms:accessRights accessRights]. In theory, the license should provide sufficient access rights information without having to specify them in accessRights also. 

Please note the Darwin Core term [http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/history/#dcterms:rights rights] has now been deprecated and should no longer be used.
