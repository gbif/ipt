= Introduction =

Since IPT v2.2 the IPT ships with 4 user directories to choose from when entering a user ID for any contact, creator, metadata provider, associated party, or project personnel. Those directories are:
 * http://orcid.org/ (ORCID)
 * http://www.researcherid.com/rid/ (ResearcherID)
 * http://scholar.google.com/citations?user= (Google Scholar)
 * https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id= (LinkedIn)

Each user directory URL will gets combined with a user ID to produce a link to the user's profile page within that directory. For example:

 [http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097 http://orcid.org/*0000-0002-1825-0097*]

The list of user directories can be modified, however, which is useful for communities that rely on other directories. 

The steps below explain how to configure the IPT with another user directory to choose from.
