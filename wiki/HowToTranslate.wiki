= Introduction =
The IPT user interface and the documentation both need internationalisation. Internationalisation is a community effort, and everyone is welcome to join. 

== User Interface ==
The preferred way of translating the user interface is using an online translation tool called [https://crowdin.com/project/gbif-ipt Crowdin]. To join, just login to [https://crowdin.com/project/gbif-ipt Crowdin], select the language you would like to translate, and hit the 'Join' button. A manager will handle your request, and add you to the translation team. After that, you can get started translating. Most people find Crowdin incredibly easy and intuitive to use. For help using Crowdin, you can always refer to their [https://support.crowdin.com/for-translators/getting-started-translators/interface-overview Knowledge Base].

If you want to translate the user interface into another language, please contact the [https://crowdin.com/profile/kbraak project owner].
