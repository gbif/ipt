= Introduction =
The IPT [HowToTranslate#User_Interface User Interface] and [HowToTranslate#User_Manual User Manual] both need internationalisation. Internationalisation is a community effort, and everyone is welcome to join. 

== User Interface ==
The preferred way of translating the user interface is using an online translation tool called [https://crowdin.com/project/gbif-ipt Crowdin]. To join, just login to [https://crowdin.com/project/gbif-ipt Crowdin], select the language you would like to translate, and hit the 'Join' button. A manager will handle your request, and add you to the translation team. After that, you can get started translating. Most people find Crowdin incredibly easy and intuitive to use. For help using Crowdin, you can always refer to their [https://support.crowdin.com/for-translators/getting-started-translators/interface-overview Knowledge Base].

=== Languages ===

  * French
  * Japanese
  * Portuguese
  * Russian (pending)
  * Spanish
  * Traditional Chinese
If you want to translate the user interface into another language, please email dev@gbif.org.

== User Manual ==
The easiest way to translate the user manual is through the Google Code wiki. Please email dev@gbif.org to get added to the project with sufficient privileges to edit the wiki. Don't worry, a project manager will help you get started. 

For new languages, a project manager needs to create a new directory under /svn/wiki using the 2-letter ISO 639-1 code as the directory name. Then the project manager will copy the English wiki page corresponding to the User Manual to this directory. That page can then be translated/edited directly through the wiki. 

Screenshots throughout the user manual should show the translated language. Screenshots are committed to a separate repository called [https://code.google.com/p/gbif-providertoolkit/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fgbif-ipt-docs gbif-ipt-docs] again using the 2-letter ISO 639-1 code to store screenshots for that language.
