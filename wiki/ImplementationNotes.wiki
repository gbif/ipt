== Key Technologies ==
 * Appfuse2 [http://appfuse.org/display/APF/AppFuse+QuickStart#AppFuseQuickStart-create Struts 2 Basic archetype]
   * planned to move to pure spring, struts2, hibernate & freemarker implementation, removing many of the appfuse overhead (which sped up initial development though)
 * 2 tier architecture with merged DAO/Service layer
 * Geoserver with custom [http://code.google.com/p/gbif-providertoolkit/source/browse/trunk/GT2-gbif-providertool/ datasource module] for WFS and maps 
 * statistic charts via google chart API using http://code.google.com/p/gchartjava/
 * Cache DB as embedded H2 database (optionally also external mysql database) 
 * lucene for full text search

=== Planned ===
 * use pingback instead of trackback which is easier to spam: alternatives, pingback vs trackback 

== Metadata ==
 * Single main user account "admin" that is used as the site tech contact (E.g in TAPIR metadata or RSS feeds)
   * other users can have admin roles too, but will not be used in TAPIR, RSS, etc
 * Individual resources have list of data curators (regular system users) assigned, which serve the TAPIR, RSS etc creator metadata
   * to configure, create or delete resources a user must also have the MANAGER role
