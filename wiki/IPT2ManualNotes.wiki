#Unfinished Notes (safety net/backup) for IPT 2.0 User Manual

Note: None of this is in wiki format - just text.

Getting Started
============
The GBIF Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) is a web application that makes it relatively simple to share biodiversity-related data sets. Data registered through an instance of the IPT are connected to the GBIF Biodiversity Resource Discovery System (GBRDS), are indexed for consultation via the GBIF portal, and made accessible for public use.

This Getting Started Guide is meant for those wishing to install and run an IPT instance for the first time. If you would like to see a functional installation of the IPT in action, you may use the public test instance of the latest general release version at http://ipt.gbif.org/. If you do so, refer to Quick Reference Guide for details on how to use the screens you will see.

*Install the IPT
???where to download the software
???what to do with the download

*Run the IPT for the first time
The IPT is meant to run in an environment that is connected to the internet.
???Go through the one-time initial steps, with screen shots?

*Test the IPT installation
???Test GBRDS, extensions, users.

*Starting Over
???

Once you have completed the steps in this Getting Started Guide, you may want to complete one of more of the tutorials to understand how common IPT tasks are accomplished. There is a also a Quick Reference Guide that explains each of the forms of the IPT in detail.
Inject his in the above as well: Please review the Administration section first, create new managers and install suitable extensions before you start managing resources.

Quick Reference
=============
Intro
This Quick Reference explains in detail the capabilities of an IPT instance that has been installed, run for the first time, and tested as given in the Getting Started Guide. The details are presented in four sections corresponding to the four "menus" available in the IPT user interface. Some tabs are only visible when a user having the appropriate permissions to see them is logged in.

Common features
*Intro: This section describes several features that are accessible from more than one page.
*Login. If no one is logged in to the IPT, one can do so for a user that has already been created in this IPT installation by entering the email address and password in the upper right-hand corner of the page, and then by clicking on the "Login" link. New users can be created only by an existing user who has Admin permission. The process for creating new users is explained under "Configure user accounts" in the Administration section. The process of initializing the IPT creates the first user having administrator permissions.
*Logout. If someone is logged in to the IPT, the email address of the person who is logged in is given in the upper right-hand corner of the of the page along with a "Logout" link.
*Account. To see this link and the page to which it leads, you must be logged in the the IPT. The page shows the details of the account information for the person who is logged in to the IPT.
*Language selection flag. In the upper right-hand corner of the page is a flag depicting the language in which the IPT is currently being presented. The default language for the IPT is English. The language of the user interface can be changed by clicking on the flag and selecting a flag for the desired language, if available.  GBIF actively seeks translations for the IPT in additional languages. See???
*Version. At the left of the footer at bottom of the page is the version of the IPT that is currently running. The version information can be used to determine which features are included in the IPT and what bugs are known to exist. 
*About the IPT Project. This link (http://code.google.com/p/gbif-providertoolkit/) leads to the project code site for the IPT, where further information about the IPT can be found, including the latest version of this manual.
*Report a bug. This link (http://code.google.com/p/gbif-providertoolkit/issues/list/) opens the list of known open issues for the IPT. If you think you have encountered a bug, look at the list of known issues first to see if the bug has already been reported. If it has, you may add new information to the existing bug report that might help engineers to diagnose the problem and get it fixed. If no bug similar to the one you have encountered in the IPT appears on the list, you can create a new bug report by clicking on the "New issues" link. When entering a bug report, it is valuable to include the version of the IPT you are using.
*Request new feature.  This link (http://code.google.com/p/gbif-providertoolkit/issues/entry?template=Feature%20request) opens a specific form in the IPT issue tracker that can be filled in to request a capability that the IPT does not currently have. ???more?
*Copyright. The copyright for the IPT software is held by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. Details of the copyright and licensing can be seen in the About Section of this User Manual.

Home (visible to all users)
*Intro: This page allows users to view a list of public resources, if any, and to look at the detailed metadata of any resource on the list. If there are any public resources, they will appear in a table with the following columns:
**Name - the title of the resource as given in the Title entry of the resource metadata. The Name appears as a link, which will open a <detailed metadata page> for the selected resource.
**Organisation - the organisation under which the resource has been registered, if any. See the "Configure organizations" section under "Administration" for more information about registering organisations and registering a resource under an organisation.
**Type - the category of data (specimen, checklist, etc.) in the dataset represented by the resource. 
**Records - the number of rows of data in the core data file that were successfully loaded into the IPT for the resource.
**Last modified - either the date the resource was created or the date on which the data were last modified, whichever is more recent.

*RSS feed. ???

*Detailed Metadata Page: Clicking on the Name link in the list of resources on the Home page shows shows a new page having all of the metadata about the selected resource. This is the one page where you can easily review all of the metadata for a resource. A user with Admin or Manager permissions can edit the metadata. See the section on "Editing an existing resource" under Manage Resources.

Administration (visible only to users having the Admin role)
*Intro: Clicking on the Administration menu opens a page from which the following specific administrative tasks can be accessed: (Screen shots for icons src/main/webapp/images/icons
<Configure IPT settings>
<Configure user accounts>
<Configure GBIF registration>
<Configure organizations>
<Configure Extensions>
<View IPT logs>

*Configure IPT settings
This page allows a user having Admin permission to make and change settings for the following characteristics of this IPT instance:
**Base URL - This is the URL that points to the root of this IPT installation. The URL is set automatically during the installation of the IPT ???.   The Base URL must be accessible via the Internet in order for the IPT to function properly. Configuring the IPT Base URL to localhost, for example, will not allow the instance of the IPT to be registered with GBIF, will not allow the IPT to be associated with an organization and will not allow the resources to be publicly accessible.
**Proxy URL - If the server on which the IPT is installed is routed through a proxy server, enter the host address and port number as a proxy URL in the format host:port, for example proxy.gbif.org:8080.
**Google Analytics key - If you would like to track the use of your instance of the IPT with Google Analytics, you can enable it to do so by entering your Google Analytics key. For more information about Google Analytics, including how to get a key, see ???.
**Enable GBIF Analytics - Check this box if you would like to enable GBIF to track this instance of the IPT with Google Analytics.
**Debugging Mode - Check this box if you need IPT to begin logging in the verbose debugging mode. Debugging mode is generally unnecessary unless you are trying to track a problem with the IPT. The IPT log file is located in the file debug.log in the IPT's data directory. The data directory is set during the first step in the installation process (see the <Getting Started> section of this manual). See the <View IPT logs> section for an easy way for users having Admin permission to view the debug.log file.
**IPT Server Location - This section allows the Admin to set the geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the location of the server on which the IPT is installed. Setting these coordinates allows GBIF to map the location of registered IPT installations around the world. {Once coordinates are set, the server latitude and longitude can no longer be set to blank, though they can be changed.}

*Configure user accounts
This page allows users having Admin permission to create, modify, and delete user accounts. When the page is first opened, it shows a table of existing users and basic information about them including their names, email addresses, roles, and the date and time of their last logins. 
**Create a new user - a new user can be created by first clicking on the button labelled "Create" below the list of existing users. ???{need screen shot}  A user with the email address {0} exists already

**Modify an existing user - information about users can be changed in the user details page after selecting the name of the user you wish to modify from the list of existing users. The user detail page shows all of the information about that user. The first name, last name, and role for the user can be changed by entering the new values and clicking on the button labelled "Save". 
The email address is used as an identifier within the IPT and can not be changed. If the user requires a change of email address, the correct procedure is to create a new user account with the new email address, then delete the user account having the antiquated email address.
If a user forgets a password, a new one can be generated by clicking on the button labelled "Reset Password", after which new password is given in an information message at the top of the page. The IPT does not inform the affected user of this change, so it is the responsibility of the Admin who resets the password to communicate the new one to the user.

**Delete a user - users accounts that are no longer necessary can be deleted using the user detail page accessed by selecting the name of the user you wish to delete from the list of existing users. On the user detail page, click on the button labelled "Delete" to remove this user account. Note: there are several conditions under which a user cannot be deleted. A user cannot delete an account while logged in to that account. It must be deleted from another account having Admin permission. Also, the IPT installation must always have at least one user having Admin permission, so the last remaining one can not be deleted. To do so, first create a new user having Admin permission and use that to delete the account. Finally, each resource must have at least one associated user having either Admin or Manager permission, so the last remaining Manager of a resource can not be deleted. To do so, first associate another user having Admin or Manager permission with the resources for which this user is the last remaining manager. {there is no easy way to find out which resources are so affected, as it is written to the log, not to the UI.}. See the <Resource Managers> section of <Editing an existing resource> to see how new managers can be assigned. 

*Configure GBIF registration!!!

*Configure organizations "Configure the organisations this IPT is associated with (The IPT needs to be first registered to the GBIF Network before associating organisations - grey until this is done)" (can't assign one until IPT is registered with GBIF, then one can be selected from the GBRDS)

*Configure Extensions
This page allows a user having Admin permission to enable the instance of the IPT to understand and import various pre-defined types of data, called extensions (or vocabularies). Each extension includes terms (fields) that support a specific purpose. For example, the Darwin Core Taxon extension supports the information pertaining to taxonomic names, taxon name usages, and taxon concepts. In order to share data, the appropriate extensions must first be enabled in the IPT. The first time the extensions page is opened, … 
{what happens the first time to get the extensions? Do extensions have to be registered?}

*View IPT logs - The easiest way to see the contents of the debug.log file is to click on the "complete log file" link at the top of the page.

Manage Resources (visible to users with an Admin or Manager role)
*Intro: This page allows users having the appropriate permissions (managers and administrators) to make changes to existing resources listed on the page or to create new resources.

*Create or upload a resource
**Create a new resource
**Upload an existing resource 

*Edit an existing resource
**Metadata
**Source Data
