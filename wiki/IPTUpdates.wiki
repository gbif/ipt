This page is meant to contain information about how to do IPT software and resource updates.

=== Upgrade to 2.0.3 ===

To upgrade from an earlier version of the IPT, version 2.0.3 requires the administrator to press the 
"Publish all resources" button on the Administration page immediately after specifying the location 
of the existing IPT data directory and pressing the "continue" button. 

It is always a good idea to take the precaution of backing up the existing IPT data directory before
performing an upgrade.

_These upgrade instructions, and other important information for the 2.0.3 version is included in the [http://gbif-providertoolkit.googlecode.com/files/Release%20Notes%20-%20IPT%202.0.3.txt Release Notes]._
