The GBIF Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) is an open source Java-based web application. It embeds its own database, is easily customisable and is multilingual. It has a user management feature based on roles, which allows for multiple data managers to share a common instance.

It connects and serves three types of data: taxon primary occurrence data, taxon checklists and general resource metadata. The IPT manages multiple data sources and has several upload options: relational database management systems or tab files. It does not however accept manual entries (except for individual metadata descriptions).

Its public web interface allows for data browsing and full text search. It also offers customised details pages for the three types of data, with specific functionality for each type (i.e. density maps, metadata edition).

The IPT manages Universally Unique IDentifiers (UUID), recycling existing IDs or providing new ones, as appropriate. It also manages technical metadata about the installation and allows for an easy setup of Google Analytics (TM) for usage statistics.
