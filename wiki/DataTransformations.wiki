= Introduction =
In many cases the soruce data does not easily map to given darwin core terms or defined extensions.
In order to support these data sources, one usually has to do some __data transformations__ which can be reduced to a certain number of common patterns or transformation types, that are applied in different scenarios.

Looking at the IPT data flow, transformations have to happen before data is mapped onto the final darwin core.

= Transformation Types =

== Normalisation ==

== ID Lookup ==

== Term Lookup ==
http://gbif-providertoolkit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/gbif-providertool/src/main/webapp/images/transformations/4.png

This is already implemented in the current IPT when mapping controlled vocabularies.
It would be desirable to allow term translations in any property mapping, regardless whether the term defines a controlled vocabulary or not.

== Concatenation ==
http://gbif-providertoolkit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/gbif-providertool/src/main/webapp/images/transformations/5.png

Concatenating multiple columns and fixed strings.

== Substring splitting ==
Splitting column values into substrings


= IPT Implementation =
 * on file level or rather as a temporary H2 database?
 * H2 would allow to do many of the transformations as simple SQL views, not producing any new files at all!
   # initially import all files or external SQL sources into H2
   # define h2 sql views
   # run final import/dwc-a generation on intermediate h2 db
