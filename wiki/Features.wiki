===General===
 * Serve 3 types of data: taxon occurrences, taxon checklists  and general resource metadata 
 * manages multiple datasources 
    * each datasource has a metadata description 
 * use embedded cache database to serve data & webapp 
 * upload options 
    * upload from RDBMS. Enter SQL statement or select tables/views 
    * upload tab file(s) 
 * manage dateLastModified 
    * when uploading new data (in particular new re-imported versions) into the index db compare existing and new records and determine if the record has changed. Store this date_last_updated per record so it can be used for incremental harvesting! 
 * manage UUIDs 
    * reuse existing UUIDs in master db or create new one for all records, datasets & provider. Link them to stable local IDs if possible 
 * Only hosting of data initially 
    * only metadata can be edited 
    * no forms for editing taxon occurrences or checklists 
    * data quality improvements do not change data, but only list problems and suggest changes if possible 
 * Keep technical installation metadata: techincal contact 
 * Access control 
    * user management 
    * admin user has access to all 
    * other users can manage their datasets only 
 * Data validation 
    * supports external validation services that can annotate records and datasets


===Resource Metadata===
 * store metadata info for 
    * each TaxonOccurrence and checklist datasource 
    * any other resource, no matter if online or only physically existing
 
 * Datamodel 
    * simplified EML basically extending Dublin Core with details about taxonomic, spatial and temporal context
    * archive previous versions as EML files

 * Interfaces 
    * URL to EML document 
    * pagable RSS feed
    * same metadata information (or subset) available for Occurrence+Checklist services available via WFS and TAPIR
 
 * Web application 
    * form wizard for metadata record 
    * page through all resources as  
       * alphabetical list 
       * keywords
    * find resource metadata via full text search 
    * find resources via bounding box map search
 
 * auto-generation
    * automatic creation/update of metadata record from occurrence or checklist data items (spatial+taxonomic coverage) 


===Taxon Occurrences===
 * Datamodel 
    * DwC and extension tables. "Star" schema, also see Local Index File proposal 
       * extensions can be added from central update site only 
       * default extensions: 
          * identifications 
          * multimedia 
          * GUIDs 
          * timeseries/tracking of individuals 
    * keeps URL to full record if provided outside of this tool 
 
 * Web Application 
    * per record details page incl map 
    * browsing by taxonomy, geography, record basis, institution and collection 
    * full text searching 
    * distribution maps for taxa, regions or entire dataset
 
 
 * Interfaces 
    * Darwin Core archive (text file dump of entire dataset)
    * URL based record resolution 
       * each record has a unique URL that resolves into a simple default XML serialisation 
    * WFS/WMS services based on darwincore GML application schema 
    * TAPIR intermediate with 1 fixed darwin core output model incl star schema extensions

 
===Taxonomic Checklists===
 * Datamodel 
    * DwC Taxon, i.e. a simplified TCS with taxonomic hierarchy, synonyms, nomenclatural notes 
    * keeps URL to full taxon if provided outside of this tool 
    * star scheme extensions to taxon possible for working with different species infos for example 
       * extensions translate into DwC extension classes
 
 * Web Application 
    * taxon details page 
    * browse taxonomy 
    * full text searching 
 
 * Interfaces 
    * Darwin Core archive (text file dump of entire dataset)
    * single TCS-RDF document 
    * URL based taxon resolution 
       * each taxon has a unique URL that resolves into a simple default XML serialisation 


= Planned =
    * allow comments on record and entire dataset. support pingback (allows remote annotations on blogs, gbif portal, etc.) 
    * RSS feed for records within resource

===Taxon Occurrences===
 * Data validation 
    * validation of data and creation of download tab file for updating original datasource 
    * validation of names, countries, record basis, etc via local files or central GBIF services 
    * geomancer for georeferencing
