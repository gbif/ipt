#summary User manual based on version 1.0beta

= Accounts =
The IPT is designed to be used by multiple users and resources.
We therefore work with 3 different roles, an anonymous or known user, a manager or an admin.
The IPT is divided into 3 sections according to those 3 access roles. 
The top menu reflects those roles/sections too with a primary menu shown for each section if you have the corresponding access rights.
== User registration ==
You need to register a user in order to manage resources or annotate someone else's datasets. Once registered you are assigned a User role, which does only allow you to annotate, but not manage resources. If you need Manager rights, please ask your IPT admin to assign you this role.

= Portal =
The portal is meant to publish the resources on the web and is in large parts accessible to the public without any login.
The only exception are annotations to data, which can only be done if you have a registered login.

The IPT has been tested with up to 1 million records. Larger datasets are not guaranteed to work, but might do. It is important for large datasets that your admin has assigned a lot of memory to the IPT and its hosting application server. We use 1GB of main memory for our tests. A file based occurrence source with 100.000 records may take up to 30 minutes to upload into the cache, so please be patient. It is something you don't do every day and doesn't need your attention.
