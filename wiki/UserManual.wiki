#summary User manual based on version 0.5

The IPT is designed to be used by multiple users and resources.
We therefore work with 3 different roles, an anonymous or known user, a manager or an admin.
The IPT is divided into 3 sections according to those 3 access roles. 
The top menu reflects those roles/sections too with a primary menu shown for each section if you have the corresponding access rights.

== Portal ==
The portal is meant to publish the resources on the web and is in large parts accessible to the public without any login.
The only exception are annotations to data, which can only be done if you have a registered login.
