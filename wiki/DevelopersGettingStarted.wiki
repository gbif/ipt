#summary Getting started with IPT development

== Introduction  ==

The GBIF IPT is an open source web application in Java that connects and serves biodiversity data that are registered in a GBIF IPT instance and connected to the GBIF distributed network for public consultation and use.


== Working with the Code ==

Developers should start with the [EclipseEnvironmentAndCheckstyles Eclipse Setup] page that describe how to configure the Eclipse environment for IPT development and how to setup the IPT checkstyles that enforce good programming style.

Next, the  [EclipseSetupOSX Developing IPT on Mac OS X] page describes a typical Eclipse development setup for working with IPT source code, including checking out the source and setting up run configurations for deploying and debugging the IPT web application.
