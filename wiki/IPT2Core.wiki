#summary Instructions how to add a new core to the IPT.

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Introduction =

The IPT always ships with 2 cores installed by default: taxon and occurrence. Their XML definitions can be found [http://rs.gbif.org/core/ here].

Since IPT 2.1, there is now the possibility to add custom cores to the IPT, which is useful for communities prototyping new data standards. 

[http://www.eubon.eu/ EU BON], for example, is currently working on a new [http://rs.gbif.org/sandbox/core/dwc_event.xml Event Core]. They then established the [http://eubon-ipt.gbif.org/ EU BON IPT] that uses this new core, to assist in refining the core. 

The 3 steps below illustrate how EU BON 1) created their your own custom core, 2) registered the core with GBIF, and 3) configured an IPT to use this core. These guiding steps will clearly outline the process of adding a new core to an IPT.

== Step 1. Write Core XML Definition ==

The core XML definition has to comply with the [http://rs.gbif.org/schema/extension.xsd GBIF Extension Schema]. It is easiest to simply adapt an existing core definition, such as EU BON's [http://rs.gbif.org/sandbox/core/dwc_event.xml Event Core]. 

Please note, the core definition must contain a property that serves as the identifier (e.g. eventID for the Event Core). The rowType and identifier property will be used later in the IPT configuration.  

If a new vocabulary needs to be created as a data type for a given property, the process mirrors the above only that the XML definition has to comply with the [http://rs.gbif.org/schema/thesaurus.xsd GBIF Thesaurus Schema]. Similarly, it is easiest to simply adapt an existing vocabulary definition, such as EU BON's [http://rs.gbif.org/sandbox/vocabulary/gbif/quantity-type.xml quantity type vocabulary].

== Step 2. Register Core with GBIF ==

Until the core XML definition has been finalized, it will be registered into the GBIF Sandbox Registry. Simply email your draft XML definition to the GBIF development team (dev@gbif.org). If
