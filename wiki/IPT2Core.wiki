#summary Instructions how to add a new core to the IPT.

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Introduction =

The IPT always ships with 2 default cores pre-installed: taxon and occurrence. Their XML definitions can be found [http://rs.gbif.org/core/ here].

As of IPT 2.1, there is now the possibility to add custom cores to the IPT, which is useful for communities prototyping new data standards. 

For example, the [http://eubon-ipt.gbif.org/ EU BON IPT] has been configured to publish using a new core called [http://rs.gbif.org/sandbox/core/dwc_event.xml Event Sample]. 

The 3 steps below explain how to 1) create your own custom core, 2) register the core with GBIF, and 3) install the core in your IPT.
