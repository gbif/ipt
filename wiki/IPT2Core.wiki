#summary Instructions how to add a new core to the IPT.

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Introduction =

The IPT always ships with 2 cores installed by default: taxon and occurrence. Their XML definitions can be found [http://rs.gbif.org/core/ here].

Since IPT 2.1, there is now the possibility to add custom cores to the IPT, which is useful for communities prototyping new data standards. 

[http://www.eubon.eu/ EU BON], for example, is currently working on a new [http://rs.gbif.org/sandbox/core/dwc_event.xml Event Core]. They then established the [http://eubon-ipt.gbif.org/ EU BON IPT] that uses this new core, to assist in refining the core. 

The 3 steps below illustrate how EU BON 1) created their your own custom core, 2) registered the core with GBIF, and 3) configured an IPT to use this core. These guiding steps will clearly outline the process of adding a new core to an IPT.  

= Instructions =

== Step 1. Write Core XML Definition ==

The core XML definition has to comply with the [http://rs.gbif.org/schema/extension.xsd GBIF Extension Schema]. It is easiest to simply adapt an existing core definition, such as EU BON's [http://rs.gbif.org/sandbox/core/dwc_event.xml Event Core]. 

Please note, the core definition must contain a property that serves as the identifier (e.g. http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/eventID for the [http://rs.gbif.org/sandbox/core/dwc_event.xml Event Core]). 

The process of creating a new non-core extension is exactly the same as above.  

The process of creating a new vocabulary (as a data type) for a property is different only in that the XML definition has to comply with the [http://rs.gbif.org/schema/thesaurus.xsd GBIF Thesaurus Schema]. Once again, it is easiest to adapt an existing vocabulary definition, such as EU BON's [http://rs.gbif.org/sandbox/vocabulary/gbif/quantity-type.xml quantity type vocabulary].

== Step 2. Register Core with GBIF ==

While the core definition is still undergoing changes, it gets registered into the GBIF Sandbox Registry. Registration can be performed by email your XML definition (formatted and validating) to the GBIF development team (dev@gbif.org). Once they have verified it's correct, it will be upload to [http://rs.gbif.org/sandbox/core/ http://rs.gbif.org/sandbox/core/], and included in the [http://gbrdsdev.gbif.org/registry/extensions.json Sandbox Registry's list of extensions].

When the core definition has been finalized, meaning that its set of properties has been frozen, it will be hosted at [http://rs.gbif.org/core/ http://rs.gbif.org/core/] and included in the http://gbrds.gbif.org/registry/extensions.json Live Registry's list of extensions] 

The same process applies for non-core extensions and vocabularies.

== Step 3. Configure IPT ==
