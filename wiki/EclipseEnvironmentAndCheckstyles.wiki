= Eclipse Environment and Checkstyles  =

These instructions describe how to configure the Eclipse environment for IPT development and checkstyles (that enforce good programming style). 

=== Required IPT variables ===
{{{
Eclipse (Window)->Preferences->General->Workspace->Linked Resources
# Create a variable named "M2_REPOS" pointing to your local Maven repository (i.e. ~/.m2/repository).
}}}

=== Spelling ===
{{{
Eclipse (Window)->Preferences->General->Editors->Text Editors->Spelling
# Enable spell checking and use "eclipse/settings/english.dictionary".
}}}

=== Output Filtering ===
{{{
Eclipse (Window)->Preferences->Java->Compiler->Building
# Make sure "Filtered Resources" includes ".svn/"
}}}

=== Code style/formatting ===
{{{
Eclipse (Window)->Preferences->Java->Code Style->Formatter->Import
# Use eclipse/settings/code-style/ipt-format.xml
}}}

=== Import organization ===
{{{
Eclipse (Window)->Preferences->Java->Code Style->Organize Imports->Import
# Use eclipse/settings/code-style/ipt.importorder
}}}

=== Member sort order ===
{{{
Eclipse (Window)->Preferences->Java->Appearance->Members Sort Order
# There is no import here, so make your settings match eclipse/settings/code-style/ipt-sort-order.png
}}}

First, members should be sorted by category:
 # Types 
 # Static Fields 
 # Static Initializers
 # Static Methods
 # Fields
 # Initializers
 # Constructors
 # Methods

Second, members in the same category should be sorted by visibility:
 # Public 
 # Protected
 # Default
 # Private

Third, within a category/visibility combination, members should be sorted alphabetically.
 
=== Compiler settings ===
{{{
Eclipse (Window)->Preferences->Java->Compiler
# Set the compiler compliance level to 1.6.
}}}

=== Compiler errors & warnings ===
{{{
Eclipse (Window)->Preferences->Java->Compiler->Errors/Warnings
}}}

The following warnings are suggested:
 * Code Style - Method with a constructor name
 * Potential programming problems:
  # Assignment has no effect
  # Possible accidental boolean assignment
  # 'finally' does not complete normally
  # Using a char array in string concatentation
  # Hidden catch block
  # Inexact type match for vararg arguments
 * Name shadowing and conflicts - all except "Local variable" hiding
 * Deprecated and restricted API - all
 * Unnecessary code - all except "Unnecessary 'else' statement"
 * Generic types - all except "Generic type parameter declared with final type bound"
 * Annotations:
  # Annotation is used as super interface
  # Enable @SuppressWarnings annotations

=== Checkstyle ===

Checkstyle is an Eclipse plugin that's used to enforce good programming style.
 # Install Checkstyle version 4.4.2 (newer versions will not work):
 # Copy "eclipse/settings/code-style/gwt-customchecks.jar" into: eclipse/plugins/com.atlassw.tools.eclipse.checkstyle_x.x.x/extension-libraries
 # Restart Eclipse

Import IPT Checks:
{{{
Eclipse (Window)->Preferences->Checkstyle->New...
}}}
 # Set the Type to "External Configuration File"
 # Set the Name to "IPT Checks" (important)
 # Set the location to "settings/code-style/ipt-checkstyle.xml".
 # Suggested: Check "Protect Checkstyle configuration file".
 # Click "Ok".

Import IPT Checks for Tests:
Repeat step 2, except:
 # Set the Name to "IPT Checks for Tests" (important)
 # Set the location to "settings/code-style/ipt-checkstyle-tests.xml".
