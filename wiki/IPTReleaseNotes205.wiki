==Release Notes: GBIF Integrated Publishing Toolkit 2.0.5 ==

===Upgrade instructions===

A. Performing the upgrade

Warning: It is always a good idea to take the precaution of backing up the existing IPT 
data directory before performing an upgrade. 

An upgrade can be performed in 3 steps:

1. Replace the previous .war file with the latest edition
2. Backup the existing data directory
3. Reuse the existing data directory during setup

B. Post-upgrade instructions
 
If upgrading from 2.0.3, once the upgrade is complete, resource managers should: 

1. Reset the resource subtype (if applicable), making the selection on the basic metadata 
page. The reason being that this list now refers to a controlled vocabulary in IPT 2.0.4/5 
and previous selections will have been reset. 
2. Re-save the metadata for each resource. The reason being that additional validation 
has been added to the metadata pages in IPT 2.0.4/5 in order to ensure better compliance 
with the GBIF metadata profile.

C. Other

GBIF has released a new style/CSS customization guide for IPT 2.0.5 entitled [IPT2Customization How to Style Your IPT] 

===Dependency Notes:===

This new version has been tested and designed to work on Tomcat 6.0 or 7.0.
Please note IPT 2.0.5 is still designed to run on Java 5 and later. This will be the last
version, however, that maintains support for Java 5 so please plan an upgrade
of your Java version soon to be able to support future versions.
