== Introduction ==

Since IPT v2.2 data publishers can choose to let the IPT auto generate a citation for their dataset. Before publishers had to enter their own citation. 

The auto-generated citation format includes the dataset version number and DOI. Human readers can use the DOI to link to the dataset homepage, and can use the version number to download the exact version of that dataset. This enables reproducing scientific results based on usage of the dataset. 

A detailed description of the IPT's citation format is described below. It is important to note that the format is based on DataCiteâ€™s preferred citation format, and satisfies the [https://www.force11.org/datacitation Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles]. For more information about the DataCite format, you can refer to Section 2.2 Citation of their [http://schema.datacite.org/meta/kernel-3/doc/DataCite-MetadataKernel_v3.0.pdf Metadata Schema]. Each part of the citation is described in the table below, with several examples given afterward.
