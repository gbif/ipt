= Things you can do =
 * create a local identifier if not existing

== In a database ==
 * setup a SQL view to use functions (can also be done in IPT sql source definition)
   * concatenation, splitting of strings: e.g. build full scientific name (watchout autonyms)
   * format dates ala ISO
   * create year/month/day by parsing native sql date types
 * use a UNION to merge 2 or more tables, e.g. accepted taxa and synonyms or specimen and observations
 * select fixed values (prefer to do this in IPT mapping)

== In Text Files ==
 * convert to UTF8
 * use standard CSV (i.e. delimiter = , quotation = ") or TAB files
 * make sure you have replaced line breaks, i.e. \r \n or \r\n with either simple spaces or use 2 characters "\r" to escape the line break if the intention is to preserve them
 * encode NULLs as empty fields, i.e. no characters between 2 delimiters, not \N or \NULL

= Tools =
== Unix Stream Editor,  SED ==
 * http://www.unixguide.net/unix/sedoneliner.shtml
 * http://www.brunolinux.com/02-The_Terminal/Find_and%20Replace_with_Sed.html
 * replace in place and create backup copy 
    `sed -i.old "s/\\\\N//g" allNames.txt`
 * convert DOS newlines (CR/LF) to Unix format: 
    `sed 's/.$//'`

== Character encoding converter ==
convert character encodings from Windows-1252 to UTF-8:

iconv -f CP1252 -t utf-8 example.txt > exampleUTF8.txt
}}}
