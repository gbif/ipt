= Things you can do =
== In a database ==
 * setup a SQL view to use functions (can also be done in IPT sql source definition)
   * concatenation, splitting of strings: e.g. build full scientific name (watchout autonyms)
   * format dates ala ISO
   * create year/month/day by parsing native sql date types
 * use a UNION to merge 2 or more tables, e.g. accepted taxa and synonyms or specimen and observations
 * select fixed values (prefer to do this in IPT mapping)

== In Text Files ==
 * convert to UTF8
 * replace
