#IPT server preparation considerations for various environments

= Introduction =

This page is meant to contain information about IPT installations that may vary between operating systems or servlet containers.

= Details =

==Jetty==

The IPT comes equipped with a Jetty web server and servlet container. The IPT can be launched using Jetty if you have Java 5 (minimum), Maven, and Subversion installed (Mac OSX comes with all of these installed by default). First, change the working directory to the location where you would like to put the IPT source code. Then issue the following commands:

`$ svn checkout http://gbif-providertoolkit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/gbif-ipt`<br>
`$ cd gbif-ipt`<br>
`$ mvn`<br>

The last "mvn" command should start the IPT with a local jetty instance on port 7001. You can then invoke the IPT in a web browser using the following URL :

http://localhost:7001/ipt

The first time the mvn command is run it will download many libraries and may take a long time, depending on the Internet data transfer rate. After this has been done once it will be it will be fairly fast thereafter, even if you update to the latest trunk again, which can be done by issuing the following commands form the root directory of the IPT source code:

`$ cd gbif-ipt`<br>
`$ svn up`<br>
 
==Tomcat==

The IPT is known to work with Tomcat 5.5 or later. Download the ipt.war file of the latest release of the IPT from http://code.google.com/p/gbif-providertoolkit/downloads/list. Copy the ipt.war file to the Tomcat webapps folder and then start Tomcat, or restart Tomcat if it is already running. You can then invoke the IPT in a web browser running on the same server by using the following URL:

http://localhost:8080/ipt
